# Lovable “Paste Prompt” (short)

Build a calm, wellness-dashboard inspired web app called “VelocityBank (Demo)”.
Routes: `/`, `/simulator`, `/cockpit`, `/learn`, `/vault`.

Must:
- Car dashboard first (4 vitals: Cash Flow, Interest Burn/day, Debt‑Free ETA, Next Move)
- Simulator compares baseline vs strategy
- Cockpit mode renders the same metrics as instruments
- Learn hub with micro-lessons + glossary
- Vault timeline showing interest avoided
- Warnings: cash flow <= 0, LOC utilization > 80%
- Coach tone, no shame
- Footer: “Educational tool. Not financial advice.”
- Correct math; label assumptions; no guaranteed results.

Use Tailwind + TypeScript. Keep dependencies light.

Ask me any questions you need to fully understand what I want before coding.
