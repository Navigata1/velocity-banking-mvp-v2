# North Star

## Mission
Build a calm, empowering app that helps people **see** interest, **understand** the “Money Loop,” and **simulate** debt payoff strategies so they can regain hope and agency.

## Non-negotiable principles
1. **Truth machine, not hype**
   - Show exact math and assumptions.
   - Display “Results vary” and risk flags.

2. **Cash Flow is King**
   - Every screen should reinforce: *Income − Expenses = Fuel*.
   - Users must understand that strategy fails without positive cash flow.

3. **Calm, welcoming UI**
   - No “shame UI.” No red alerts that feel like failure.
   - Use gentle language: “Adjust plan,” “Try a smaller chunk,” “Recovery Mode.”

4. **Multiple learning styles**
   - Dashboard for analytical users
   - Cockpit mode for “I need to feel it” learners
   - Micro-lessons for beginners
   - Case studies for believers/skeptics

5. **Ethical guardrails**
   - Warn if a plan depends on:
     - credit line utilization too high
     - negative cash flow
     - promotional APR expiring
     - missing minimum payments

## What “the click” feels like
People “click” when three things become obvious:
1. **Where interest is coming from** (and how it compounds over time)
2. **How moving money changes the interest basis**
3. **How eliminating one payment creates cash flow momentum**

That is the emotional arc of the product.

## The real engine: the Money Loop
**Loop definition:**
- Paycheck → LOC/HELOC (reduces interest basis immediately)
- Expenses routed (cash or expense card)
- Statement due → pay card from LOC
- Any remaining cash flow reduces LOC balance month over month
- Periodic “chunks” attack amortized debt (car/mortgage) for big timeline jumps

## MVP success criteria (measurable)
- 70% of users complete onboarding and see a first simulation result
- 40% create a plan with reminders
- 25% report “I finally understand interest / amortization”
- Retention driver: weekly “Vitals” check-in (same vibe as health apps)
