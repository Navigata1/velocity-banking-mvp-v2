# Vercel Release Alias Runbook

Last updated: 2026-06-16

## Current Release State

- `main` contains the InterestShield 2026 release stack at merge commit `cebeede30c6b5f52ab5aaa0b58d1114df0ddc284`.
- GitHub CI passed on `main` run `27596359559`.
- GitHub recorded a successful Vercel deployment for the merge commit:
  - `https://velocity-banking-mvp-v2-4jmnl51zf-islanddevcrew.vercel.app`
- That deployment URL currently returns HTTP `401`, consistent with Vercel Deployment or Preview Protection.
- The public alias `https://web-islanddevcrew.vercel.app/` still serves the older app deployment marker `dpl_FfPyuRhZM8G4pTofYifoajjVDpLg`.
- The public alias does not expose the current release markers:
  - `data-testid="primary-navigation"`
  - `money-loop-artifact-rail`
  - `money-loop-payoff-orbit`
- Tracking issue: `https://github.com/Navigata1/velocity-banking-mvp-v2/issues/59`

## Required Vercel Actions

1. Reauthenticate Vercel access.
   - Vercel MCP currently reports reauthentication required.
   - `npx vercel whoami`, `npx vercel inspect`, and `npx vercel ls` time out or wait for authentication in the local Codex environment.
   - Chrome can open the Vercel project overview, but the Domains and Deployments pages redirect to login.

2. Confirm the project that owns the release.
   - Expected team slug: `islanddevcrew`
   - Expected project slug: `velocity-banking-mvp-v2`
   - Vercel project page: `https://vercel.com/islanddevcrew/velocity-banking-mvp-v2`

3. Connect the project to Git if needed.
   - The Vercel overview showed the project checklist still includes `Connect Git Repository`.
   - Confirm the Vercel project is connected to `Navigata1/velocity-banking-mvp-v2`.
   - Confirm production builds trigger from `main`.

4. Promote or alias the current release build.
   - Promote the deployment for `cebeede30c6b5f52ab5aaa0b58d1114df0ddc284`, or a newer passing `main` deployment, to the public production alias.
   - Public alias to update first: `https://web-islanddevcrew.vercel.app/`
   - Add or update the final InterestShield custom domain after the alias smoke passes.

5. Decide protection posture.
   - If the production domain is public, the URL should be unprotected and `apps/web` `npm run smoke:production` should pass without a bypass secret.
   - If production protection is intentionally enabled, configure `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` in GitHub and rerun the release smoke workflow with that secret.

## Verification Commands

Run from `apps/web` after the Vercel alias is corrected:

```powershell
npm run smoke:production
```

To test a different origin:

```powershell
$env:PRODUCTION_ORIGIN='https://your-domain.example'
npm run smoke:production
Remove-Item Env:PRODUCTION_ORIGIN
```

Expected pass criteria:

- `/`, `/simulator`, `/cockpit`, `/portfolio`, `/learn`, `/settings`, and `/vault` return HTTP `200`.
- Each route returns `text/html`.
- Each route exposes `data-testid="primary-navigation"`.
- The response does not include Vercel deployment failure, protection, or stale-shell signatures.

## Rendered Freshness Smoke

After the HTTP production smoke passes, run Browser or Chrome against the public production alias.

Required rendered markers on `/`:

- `money-loop-artifact-rail`
- `money-loop-payoff-orbit`
- `dashboard-vital-cash-flow`
- `dashboard-vital-interest-burn`
- `dashboard-vital-debt-free-eta`
- `dashboard-vital-next-move`

Required rendered checks:

- The dashboard loads without the old intro gate.
- Console warnings/errors are empty or explainable and non-blocking.
- The Money Loop payoff orbit is visible.
- The four dashboard vitals are visible.
- No horizontal overflow on the initial dashboard viewport.

## GitHub Release Record

After verification passes:

1. Comment on issue #59 with:
   - production alias checked
   - deployment URL or commit deployed
   - `npm run smoke:production` result
   - Browser/Chrome rendered freshness result
2. Close issue #59.
3. If the final InterestShield custom domain was added, update this runbook with the domain and rerun the same smoke steps against it.
