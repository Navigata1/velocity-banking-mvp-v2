It turns fear into clarity in 2–3 minutes.

Storyboard beats:
1) Character pays bills, feels stuck
2) “Interest leak” is shown draining their tank daily
3) They route paycheck to LOC first → leak slows
4) They route expenses strategically → tank holds more fuel
5) They make a “chunk” → big jump forward
6) Ending: “Small changes create momentum.”
