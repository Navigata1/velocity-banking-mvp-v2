00:04:23.880 while I'm talking about what I'm going to talk about here you are welcome to ask me and I will
00:04:30.060 answer them by the end of the video anyway
00:04:35.100 oh here's a question already Beth
00:04:40.740 Beth says if you use all your income on your credit cards is that bad or should
00:04:47.100 you keep saving in the bank that is such a question
00:04:53.580 you have like a company that helps people brain I am the company that helps
00:04:59.220 people so if you want to send me a contact form um if you need help with your own
00:05:05.000 situation or you're wanting your own scenario I have links below each video for that Beth back to your question I'm
00:05:13.380 just going to show you um if you have a five thousand dollar
00:05:19.020 credit card and let's say I know that the interest rates on the credit cards are up to 30
00:05:26.280 percent right now and maybe more the ones I'm dealing with mainly right now we're at 28 to 30 percent on the credit
00:05:33.780 cards so if you are up to a 28 let's say
00:05:39.120 and you have a five thousand dollar balance and then you have
00:05:45.360 five thousand dollars in savings
00:05:51.120 if this is your five thousand dollar credit card that you owe
00:05:59.160 then
00:06:06.960 you're paying three dollars and 83 cents a day just to leave this sitting there
00:06:15.000 which means you're losing 3.83 a day on your savings unless you
00:06:21.780 have a 28 percent that's offsetting
00:06:28.160 so that's why it is really really
00:06:34.139 ignorant it's wasting your money your wealth to
00:06:40.020 leave balances sitting on credit cards when you have money and savings because
00:06:46.759 this could wipe this out completely you would be saving that putting that
00:06:53.759 back in your pocket literally then after you are this is paid off you have
00:07:02.819 five thousand dollars of credit for emergency funds now
00:07:08.940 so this will cover all emergencies up to hospital visits up to Flat tires
00:07:16.919 automobile repairs so when you think that you're saving money but yet you're
00:07:23.460 letting balances sit on credit cards you are losing
00:07:29.160 every day that that balance sits on that credit card if you have the savings okay
00:07:35.099 so did that answer your question we're going to talk about credit cards today
00:07:41.280 um I'm gonna go over I'm gonna go I'm gonna show how why we
00:07:48.539 do the income transfer because I get a lot of questions about what's the point of putting the income into the credit
00:07:55.560 card and so I kind of want to show it uh the best way that I think would be an
00:08:01.860 elementary showing I guess because I everything has to be simple for me to
00:08:08.160 understand it and so that's why I put it out for you guys to understand it that way as well
00:08:14.160 at least I hope that you all are learning from the elementary way I have
00:08:19.979 of teaching because I could never be a school teacher but I just know how I
00:08:26.220 learned it and so it helps when I see things visually it helps me I'm a
00:08:32.820 Hands-On person so I can learn faster when I am seeing something rather than just reading about it in a book
00:08:40.700 uh rain says I got myself in trouble trying this velocity banking because I
00:08:45.779 wasn't disciplined enough and helped my adult kids who are having financial difficulties yeah I mean that
00:08:53.880 happens that happens that happens with me uh good Beth I'm glad that was a good
00:09:00.360 answer for you exactly so Jesus says every day your
00:09:06.839 checking account isn't at zero you're losing put your money to work
00:09:11.880 I always have a zero balance in my checking account always
00:09:17.160 you all should have if you're doing velocity banking keep a zero balance in your checking account make sure that
00:09:23.940 money is working so if you have any loans you have any debt make sure that
00:09:29.940 money is working through a line of credit and not wasting okay because
00:09:35.100 every day like I said that 3.83 you're wasting every day that five thousand
00:09:41.339 dollar balance sits on a card okay
00:09:46.620 so let's talk about this just a second we have an income of five thousand
00:09:51.959 dollars that we're going to be talking about the cash flows fifteen hundred and how
00:09:58.740 do we get cash flow do I need to go over that because I keep getting questions about that as well what is cash flow
00:10:06.000 okay if I have gas that I have to put in my car every month of two hundred
00:10:11.820 dollars and I have an electric bill and that's two hundred dollars
00:10:19.260 and I buy food and that's two hundred dollars that
00:10:24.480 would be six hundred dollars and expenses that I have every single month
00:10:31.500 so if I have income of one thousand dollars a month
00:10:39.480 my expenses come out of that that will leave me four hundred dollars
00:10:45.899 a month in cash flow
00:10:53.760 cash flow is what you have left over after you have deducted every expense
00:11:01.140 you have in a month out of your income now if you have tithe like I have tithes
00:11:07.500 let's say you paid 200 a month in your tithe then that would mean you have 800
00:11:13.680 inexpenses every month comes out of your thousand which means now you have two
00:11:19.500 hundred dollars cash flow okay I hope that makes sense to everybody because I have had a lot of
00:11:25.860 questions on that I actually have a video coming out one day this week explaining cash flow a little deeper
00:11:34.620 because I really want people to understand where that cash flow comes from
00:11:41.640 and how we get it and you can increase it by reducing your expenses I don't
00:11:47.880 teach frugality on this channel because I feel like Dave Ramsey does enough of
00:11:52.980 that for all of us and if you want frugality if you want beans and rice
00:11:59.360 if if you want to talk about Congress overspending which I agree with him you
00:12:06.180 need to go to Dave Ramsey because he can teach you how to save money and how to
00:12:13.019 put your extra payments on your loans it was just taken me uh 55 years to clean
00:12:20.940 my debt up by doing that when I learned about velocity banking I got my deck cleaned up in less than a year and
00:12:28.079 that's what I'm hoping that these videos will do for you Dave Ramsey is not teaching a wrong
00:12:33.959 method he's just teaching a 1960s method that is very very slow
00:12:40.980 and there's nothing wrong with that if you are a spender and you cannot control
00:12:46.079 how you spend your money on your credit cards or you know when it's deposited
00:12:51.720 into the bank then you need to go with Dave Ramsey because he does teach uh
00:12:57.060 frugality he teaches you how to stop spending and that just wasn't for me so
00:13:04.620 um any questions about that I'm not a hater I mean I really appreciate him and I think he's a really
00:13:10.800 good man but he just doesn't I can't do finances that way I felt like that I was
00:13:17.899 suffocating and every time I wanted something or I wanted to go out and eat
00:13:23.880 I can't do that because I'm a sinner and I have to clean up my mess you know and I mean
00:13:29.700 um it's just like when I learned about velocity banking it took that
00:13:35.100 change you know the Big Chain of debt you have wrapped around your neck or
00:13:40.980 that stressor that you have that you can never spend money or you can never you know buy a new pair of shoes or whatever
00:13:48.180 it takes that off it lets you relax a little bit it sets you up on a strategy
00:13:54.600 so now you can go to work focus on your income focus on your family and let your
00:13:59.760 debt slowly pay down well let your debt quickly pay down if
00:14:04.920 you have the right cash flow Jesus is talking to okay he's talking to
00:14:11.519 someone else so we'll just let him talk okay so let's talk about the ten
00:14:16.620 thousand dollar credit card balance this will work no matter what your cash
00:14:22.260 flow is I am just showing here that by the time
00:14:27.779 he pays his expenses are going to be 2 000 now let me go over that a little bit
00:14:36.060 when you have this person has a five thousand dollar income
00:14:41.220 the 1500 up here that you see expenses in bank that means you have to leave
00:14:48.120 your mortgage payments um your car payments stuff like that that has to be paid with cash through
00:14:56.160 your checking account you will have to leave that money in the bank so let's
00:15:01.199 say they have a thousand dollars for rent and then 500 for a car I don't know what
00:15:09.180 exactly it is but let's say that they have to have fifteen hundred dollars to pay these two debts out of
00:15:17.100 their checking account so this is going to stay in the bank for the rent and the
00:15:22.500 car now there's two thousand dollars in living expenses that is their food
00:15:28.740 remember what I said they're gas their utilities
00:15:36.779 um subscriptions karate glass
00:15:42.000 medical bills whatever other expenses that you have
00:15:47.100 that you can pay with a credit card that's what this two thousand dollars is going to be in this scenario that I'm
00:15:54.120 getting ready to show you here so the two thousand dollars
00:16:01.320 that can be paid on a credit card will go
00:16:06.360 onto the credit card then the 1500 that was in cash flow will
00:16:12.540 also be deposited into the credit card every month so we're going to show the 5
00:16:19.380 000 income we're going to show that fifteen hundred dollars is going to stay in the bank for
00:16:26.699 rent then we're going to show that 2 000 plus
00:16:33.899 1500 which is the expenses plus the cash flow is going to go
00:16:41.279 on to the credit card okay and that will Zero out the five
00:16:48.360 thousand notice none of the five thousand dollars is going to go into a
00:16:54.240 savings account and it's not going to go sit in the bank it's going to go work in
00:16:59.579 the bank because you have payments to pay there are ways to pay through credit
00:17:05.520 cards but simplistic says leave the cash in the
00:17:11.280 bank and deposit everything else that you have to have into the card that is
00:17:17.760 what I'm getting ready to show you this is why we do that this is why we do it
00:17:24.179 sorry I'm sorry I've got I got music on my mind
00:17:31.919 let's see what Jay is saying I have a question I have two credit cards first
00:17:38.160 card has a limit of 14k the balance is five thousand should I use the
00:17:45.059 difference approximately six thousand to pay off card number two or zero percent
00:17:50.700 the term is only for 10 months so not sure I'll have enough time to pay down before
00:17:57.660 promo rate expires cash flow is on probably 400 a month
00:18:02.940 okay first card
00:18:08.220 yeah the he's right with me you must be like born in the the you know 70s that
00:18:14.580 grew up in the 80s as well um Jay um
00:18:22.140 you can do that if you get to the zero percent time that it's coming up you
00:18:27.720 know like in your 10 months you can transfer that over to card number one and
00:18:35.220 um go ahead and pay it off then but I would leave it at the 400 uh your 400 cash
00:18:42.960 flow should be going into the one that has the interest rate that way you can be getting that one paid off then when
00:18:50.280 card number two is due uh where that zero percent is getting ready to expire then transfer that balance over and pay
00:18:57.960 that off and then let your cash flow work on the one with the interest charge
00:19:03.960 okay does that make sense foreign
00:19:09.500 says I'm able to pay my rent with credit card is that helping me with this in
00:19:14.760 order to save cash flow well in this video we're not going to be
00:19:20.700 putting the rent in but you're going to be able to see what the difference on
00:19:25.799 your interest rate would be if you were able to put the rent into the credit card okay
00:19:37.280 okay so let's start we have a ten thousand dollar credit
00:19:43.380 card balance right here I hope you all can see me um it's
00:19:50.059 7.67 per day is being charged on this card at 30 percent okay so like I was
00:19:58.200 saying earlier the credit card interest rates are going up I think the feds
00:20:05.400 announced they're going to be raising that again so as many times as they do
00:20:11.340 that the higher the interest goes on these cards so I figured this at 30 percent
00:20:18.299 so it's 7.67 per day in interest now
00:20:25.080 with this scenario right here where we're going to be taking thirty five hundred dollars per month
00:20:32.460 transferring it into this credit card then we're going to pull two thousand
00:20:38.280 dollars a month out in expenses so that's the way this is how this will go
00:20:43.679 you have a ten thousand dollar balance today's payday you're going to put in thirty five
00:20:50.220 hundred dollars
00:20:57.960 please excuse my graph ability because I am not like
00:21:03.660 a grapher is that a word so be patient with me
00:21:09.240 okay so when we deposit the thirty five hundred dollars actually
00:21:15.600 we'll bring that down to about right here yep not good at this deposit the 3 500
00:21:22.080 we now have a sixty five hundred dollar balance right because we put thirty five
00:21:28.380 hundred in foreign and it brought that balance down
00:21:34.080 to sixty five hundred dollars now what did that do to the interest rate because it was 7.67 right here
00:21:45.360 four dollars and 78 cents a day now in interest
00:21:51.419 so do you see how it dropped it three dollars some almost three dollars
00:21:58.260 just in one deposit okay so in one deposit
00:22:03.980 3500 dropped this interest rate down three dollars a day now your expenses of
00:22:11.640 two thousand dollars is going to have to come back out right
00:22:16.799 so throughout the month it slowly slowly slowly comes out
00:22:22.440 and now your balance is back up to eighty five hundred dollars
00:22:28.380 all right so now we're at 8 500 uh ten thousand I mean you see the
00:22:35.400 balance has already come down this is just your first month's deposits you
00:22:40.559 didn't get Frugal you just put your money where it serves you so it's knocked the interest down here
00:22:49.260 but with this you're back up to six dollars and 52 cents a day now this is
00:22:55.620 30 interest remember month two you're going to come in and you're going to make another deposit
00:23:03.900 of thirty five hundred dollars oh look you there where are we at now
00:23:12.659 five thousand dollar balance we've already knocked this thing down half and
00:23:17.700 we're not doing anything just putting our income in pulling our expenses out
00:23:22.980 so at the five thousand dollar rate we're paying three dollars and 83 cents
00:23:28.260 a day and interest as long as it sits there that's what's nice about the revolving
00:23:34.919 line of credit is your never really going to pay the 7.67 a day this is if
00:23:43.559 you leave that ten thousand dollar balance sitting there for the whole year
00:23:49.200 okay for the whole year
00:23:54.900 we're not going to be leaving it sitting there at all after you learn this method and you get paid tomorrow you're going
00:24:01.980 to know hey I'm throwing my income into that card and I am knocking it way way
00:24:07.919 down okay so just going back over it let's review ten
00:24:15.299 thousand dollar balance you throw your thirty five hundred dollars which is your cash flow and your expenses you can
00:24:22.620 pay with a credit card onto the card knocks the balance down to 6500
00:24:31.140 your expenses of two thousand slowly come back out now remember you might buy
00:24:36.780 food here you might buy gas here you might pay your cable bill here
00:24:45.120 maybe you pay your rent here no not your rent I'm sorry we left the rent out pay your cable pay your
00:24:52.620 subscriptions pay your dog food pay diapers whatever you need throughout the
00:24:58.320 month we'll slowly start building this balance back up to where that if it gets
00:25:04.980 built up before you get your next paycheck it'll be at 8 500 okay
00:25:11.700 then you're going to make another 3 500 deposit or transfer into the card bring
00:25:17.640 in the balance to 5 000. guess what it's slowly going to be working its way back
00:25:24.419 up again through the month and looky here our balance now is at seven thousand
00:25:32.039 dollars because we have two thousand dollars in expenses this is the worst graph you all
00:25:38.580 have ever seen and I Know It please please I'm not an artist
00:25:45.360 okay back to where we were so you're buying your food your gas paying your electric uh paying your subscriptions
00:25:53.419 paying for your Taekwondo class maybe your karate class getting your nails
00:25:59.340 done getting your hair cut see it's slowly moving back up
00:26:05.039 we're going to be at seven thousand dollars we're on paying five dollars and 36
00:26:11.159 Cents a day in interest here what happens now what's going to happen
00:26:17.220 what's this you're going to make another thirty five hundred dollar deposit
00:26:23.460 and look at that your account is going to be at thirty
00:26:29.039 five hundred dollar balance isn't that beautiful the way this works
00:26:34.500 I mean it doesn't get any easier because you're
00:26:39.720 not not eating out you're not on uh you know eating
00:26:45.960 spaghetti every night with nothing but butter or vinegar or something you're
00:26:52.080 literally living your life enjoying your life while you're doing nothing but
00:26:57.779 paying down your credit cards now in the 3500 we have a 2.68
00:27:06.020 a day interest charge now we gotta go in and watch our
00:27:12.840 expenses come back out again here we are at five thousand dollars
00:27:21.000 is that right 85 35 7 30 yeah so we're back at five thousand we know the
00:27:27.779 interest is 383 here no I'm sorry this is two thousand dollars in expenses

00:28:38.039 cents a day in interest isn't that I mean can I get like a high
00:28:43.559 five hands up like you'll praise him something because this is how the game
00:28:50.159 is played and it's also simple and it's so freeing
00:28:56.700 to get this junk off of you so we're gonna go in here and we're
00:29:02.820 going to pay our expenses again which will only take us back up to four thousand
00:29:13.200 so if we're at 4 000 we're paying 306 in interest a day
00:29:20.520 and oh my goodness do you see what we're getting ready to do
00:29:26.159 we're going to make another 3 500 deposit and look we are at five hundred dollar balance
00:29:38.580 how how many how long did that take us one two
00:29:44.640 three four
00:29:50.279 five months five months and you took a ten thousand
00:29:56.640 dollar balance to five hundred dollars and I could like I don't know like
00:30:04.919 run around the room right now and excitement and it's not even my debt
00:30:10.140 it's exciting to watch people that are stressed out with debt like this just
00:30:18.539 totally overwhelmed oh my gosh okay so I listened to Dave
00:30:24.840 Ramsey sometimes because I think he's very interesting and he had a lady on I
00:30:31.500 wish wish I could talk to her because she had um she had four children at home
00:30:40.260 her husband made eighty three thousand dollars a year great income
00:30:45.779 and their debt came to eighty thousand dollars and they had a HELOC with a forty
00:30:54.000 thousand dollar balance and I literally was like giving me her information and
00:31:01.140 because he was telling her yeah three years it's gonna take you three years and you're all not gonna be able to do
00:31:06.240 anything I mean nothing and they had already started being Frugal and she
00:31:12.000 said their kids were feeling it and you know all this stuff and ah sometimes when I listen to him I get
00:31:19.740 so overwhelmed because I would love to just hug those people that he's talking down to and say hold on because there's
00:31:28.440 a way out of this there's a layout and it's not going to be difficult and you're still going to
00:31:34.620 be able to eat and you're still going to be able to keep your cars just hang with
00:31:40.740 me here but wow uh yes Dave hates credit cards no matter what and I understand if
00:31:48.659 you're out of control and you have a spending problem don't use credit cards
00:31:54.500 totally not your thing but if you want to get out of debt if you've had it up
00:32:00.600 to here with net this is the way out after you get done with this card in
00:32:07.980 five months you turn around put all of your expenses on your next card do the
00:32:13.140 same thing so literally in 10 months you could have twenty thousand dollars in
00:32:19.200 debt paid off twenty thousand and this person only had a five thousand
00:32:25.620 dollar income so if you have anything over five thousand uh and you just
00:32:31.260 halfway watch your expenses you're in great shape okay now if you're on here and you didn't

00:33:18.059 if this didn't make sense I don't know how much more I can break
00:33:23.399 it down uh but if this didn't make sense please ask questions
00:33:30.600 hi Eve let's see
00:33:38.039 yeah Jesus says I'm no gazelle intense beans and rice baby steps needed
00:33:45.539 uh like I said I am not the meaning that Dave Ramsey I'm just saying there is a
00:33:51.779 faster easier way um so Eve did you understand the
00:33:56.880 beautiful graph that I made here did it make sense to all on here uh it's not
00:34:03.600 pretty but this is life-changing this is life-changing
00:34:09.480 information for anybody that will use it thank you I think it's gorgeous thank you
00:34:17.219 um let's see Jay and Jesus have a conversation going on
00:34:24.659 um yeah I love the graph
00:34:30.480 oh good Veronica it's so good it was I wanted it to be totally understandable
00:34:35.639 totally making sense I uh Sky ask a question how do you feel
00:34:43.020 about pulling money out of your 401k I feel like the 401K is our next thing to
00:34:49.560 a bad government joke and I know that you can't pull it without
00:34:56.520 um penalties when you're 59 and a half and they set that up for a good reason
00:35:02.160 because you're keeping all that money in there and then when you have to pull it at 59 and a half you're going to pay
00:35:08.580 gosh awful taxes because you've let that thing sit there for 30 years that you
00:35:14.220 didn't pay the taxes on um uh
00:35:19.560 I don't know I just think that if you uh want to pull it I was talking to a man
00:35:25.859 this week he has uh he can pull 50 000 because that's the limit
00:35:31.440 he has over a million in it but you can only take half of it up to a hundred
00:35:37.740 thousand so fifty thousand is the max on a loan he could take that out he could
00:35:44.099 pay college tuition but he's going to pay 506 dollars a
00:35:49.980 month back because of the eight percent uh interest rate on that so we were
00:35:56.820 talking about infinite banking with him and he's going to be looking into policies like that instead of you know
00:36:06.060 taking those withdrawals out of the 401K because he is not 59 and a half okay
00:36:14.820 um nowadays a 401k is a 101k
00:36:22.320 um I can't even joke about 401ks because I feel like that everybody jumped into
00:36:28.800 that because oh we're going to save money plus we're going to get out of paying taxes when you do uh
00:36:36.960 uh yeah I just don't think that's I don't think that's a good good
00:36:44.400 um I don't think that that's a good way to save not when you can be doing infinite
00:36:49.680 Banking and get compound interest okay so does anyone have any questions that
00:36:55.980 this made sense so I I gotta I got a a chat back that said it was a good visual
00:37:03.839 um I am releasing some videos talking more about this this week and talking about
00:37:10.200 cash flow breaking that down people's having a really hard time understanding What expenses are and how we figure that
00:37:17.820 out of our credit cards or figure it in or whatever so I literally did one short
00:37:23.700 video on just showing the breakdown of your expenses how to figure that how to get that out of your credit card what
00:37:31.079 you need to leave into the bank for your cash payments which would be car
00:37:36.720 payments stuff like that so I will erase this now if you all don't have any
00:37:41.880 questions about it but the point is is one when you're putting as much of your
00:37:48.839 income in as you can I realize you can't put it all in sometimes
00:37:55.020 but if you're putting in as much as you can you're knocking the balance down that's saving you this three dollars a
00:38:02.579 day in interest three dollars a day is a lot of money right
00:38:07.859 so if you can save three dollars a day and put it back in your pocket instead
00:38:13.380 of giving it to a bank you're already a step ahead
00:38:18.900 but then when you're pulling your expenses back out and it's just bringing you back up to 8 500
00:38:26.280 where now you have literally saved 1500 on your balance and you didn't even do
00:38:33.660 anything but just put your money in a place that serves you I say that in
00:38:40.079 every video because you're serving the bank when you're leaving this sitting here and if you have five thousand
00:38:46.380 dollars in savings and you're sitting there and letting the bank draw off of that as well because they're making
00:38:52.619 money off of your savings that you have sitting in their Bank
00:38:59.300 let's think about this a second I'm going to put five thousand dollars
00:39:04.980 in the bank and let them pay me point zero zero three five percent okay
00:39:10.500 because that's like the going rate is less than half a percent now some things are higher right now because the
00:39:16.500 interest rates are higher but that's the norm is to make less than half a percent on a savings account in a bank
00:39:25.200 but then you're saying I won't use my five thousand I'll borrow 5 000 from you
00:39:31.260 and I'll pay you four dollars a day to borrow your five thousand even though I
00:39:36.839 don't really need to because I already have five thousand thousand so I'll leave the 5 000 setting
00:39:42.900 in there because and you know emergency might come up and I need some cash
00:40:01.380 am I back on I think I lost everybody but is that the way we feel about our
00:40:08.940 savings though it makes us a little crazy good
00:40:16.200 so when you the point is is that if you have savings you're paying the bank
00:40:23.700 to let your savings sit in there when you're using their money
00:40:29.520 so thank you thank you Gloria Gloria
00:40:34.619 I mean I could really get down every time I hear that song I don't know why um my daughter some of this new age
00:40:41.220 music these guys are listening to is like I'm like what is that even I laugh at
00:40:47.760 them because I'm like you all they literally have you noticed that this new
00:40:52.920 music they're taking the sound of the
00:40:57.960 80s music and they're making their music or they're like redoing it but it's just sometimes even
00:41:04.859 have the same words and I'm like that's not even that's that's laughable that y'all can't even come up with your own
00:41:11.040 music you gotta come steal ours right I'm joking I don't even care I don't even listen to today's music
00:41:21.340 [Laughter] Gracie I'm not talking about you just
00:41:26.820 because you're 15 doesn't mean that you're listening to this new age junk music
00:41:35.820 yes that is what CD knows Dino's okay so my daughter played this song oh my gosh
00:41:42.540 which one was it hold on let me think
00:41:48.599 I don't know but I think that it was like um one of George Michael's songs and
00:41:55.980 they had taken his Song and all they did was
00:42:02.220 slowed it way down or spit it way up I can't remember and it was literally like
00:42:07.920 okay and she's like hey Mom listen to this new song and I'm like that is not
00:42:13.920 new dude you stole that give it back
00:42:19.820 ah let's see and all you can hear is the song back in
00:42:25.859 the day right so once you're debt free what do you do with the cash flow I love Infinite
00:42:33.420 banking your money needs to go into a fund that
00:42:39.000 is growing money because then you can turn around pull that out of infinite Banking and then go invest in yourself
00:42:46.560 the video that I had I guess it's been a few weeks ago now that literally invest in yourself I want
00:42:55.140 to scream that invest in yourself don't be putting your money in a savings
00:43:01.500 account and letting it sit do the infinite banking pull it back out if you can get hooked up with an
00:43:08.099 e-commerce store if you can do YouTube videos if you can do
00:43:15.300 Etsy do anything invest in yourself make the money make passive income put more
00:43:23.099 money into your infinite banking that's the whole point because
00:43:28.319 you're not being greedy you are being a good Steward over what God has given you
00:43:33.859 to use so if you're being a good Steward first you're giving and you're tithing
00:43:40.440 two major game changers when it comes to your finances you need the blessing and
00:43:47.220 that's how it comes once you're into your giving and your tithing then all
00:43:52.500 the extra cash flow that needs to be going to uh grow just like the man that
00:43:59.700 the master that gave the talents to the servants he didn't he didn't like it
00:44:05.160 that the guy had buried it just to sit there and be the same he wanted it worked he wanted it he wanted it to be
00:44:14.220 worked he wanted that money to be working so that when he came back he could at least get interest off the bank
00:44:22.319 same for today you're blessed with funds he's given you funds to take care of all you have to do
00:44:30.000 is take care of it and make it grow this is one way you're growing it by getting
00:44:35.280 out of pain your interest okay you can make it grow like I said invest in
00:44:41.040 yourself uh take a course I mean uh certificates are so easy to get and they
00:44:47.400 make you so much more money than getting a college degree does so I work with
00:44:52.440 doctors I work with lawyers I see their student loans they will never work out
00:44:58.800 of their student loans with what they make I know that sounds crazy but we're
00:45:04.740 talking five hundred thousand dollars in college uh tuition
00:45:12.060 to be a doctor and you're like okay
00:45:17.880 um by the time the interest grows on that there's a documentary on that oh my
00:45:23.220 goodness I wish I could remember the name of that but it talks about the doctors and the
00:45:28.680 lawyers and the student loans and how they cannot get out from underneath them
00:45:34.680 because the interest on those things the way they got them or set up or whatever
00:45:40.079 is eating them up and has the government paid off your
00:45:45.359 student loans yet I didn't think so so get some things off
00:45:52.859 of you that's going to take some work throw them into a line of credit do it just like this credit card get it paid
00:45:59.520 off and get that out because I know that's suffocating oh my gosh
00:46:04.619 so I'm working with people that have astronomical student loans and it's just
00:46:11.099 going to take some time doing this right here throwing it onto a line of credit and working it down
00:46:19.200 you gotta work it down let's see what everybody's saying hi Jazz
00:46:26.300 Vinnie your favorite yes jazz is my number one fan
00:46:34.020 uh gray season number two Eaves number three just kidding I don't that's a joke
00:46:43.260 um we'll catch if it depends you want one with a big limit but you're also on
00:46:49.740 lower interest rates your credit cards when what in the world or what did I miss oh
00:46:56.700 I'm new to Velocity Banking and have several CC do I use the credit card with
00:47:02.160 the most credit limit cold cat says well it depends on what you're going to be
00:47:08.099 doing with that what are you going to be doing with the
00:47:13.140 limit you would really what I always go for is
00:47:18.359 what your best cash flow if this card's sitting at ten thousand dollars let's say it has a 600 a month
00:47:26.700 payment and then you have a five thousand dollar card with a three hundred dollar month
00:47:32.460 payment I would take the ten thousand because once you knock off
00:47:39.720 that six hundred dollar payment guess what that became cash flow and that pays
00:47:45.000 off your credit card did that make sense did that make sense is everybody done
00:47:51.420 with this board if you didn't get it a video will be
00:47:57.599 releasing with another one of these beautiful graphs showing this so you're you can catch it
00:48:04.440 uh probably I don't know it might come out next week
00:48:09.900 I don't know what order the videos are going to come out I just know that they are set up and ready to release
00:48:21.900 you all like my little fuzzy have you ever seen one of these is that cute as a button or what
00:48:32.400 um when I was talking to cat about
00:48:38.220 which card to use first as far as to do the velocity on oh and these look at
00:48:44.640 these you see these pink ones they never erase that's why I never use colors look at this you have to like really do some
00:48:52.140 elbow grease to get those off
00:48:58.740 okay don't forget to enter to win
00:49:04.619 okay don't forget to enter to win I love I love that giving away money thing that's
00:49:11.400 so much fun okay so
00:49:18.359 hat this is for you this is for cat foreign
00:49:27.680 credit card and it has a six hundred dollar a month
00:49:34.319 payment okay
00:49:40.319 and you have five thousand dollars in income a month that you can put on here
00:49:52.280 that leaves this at a five thousand dollar balance until your expenses come
00:49:57.720 on but you just wiped out that six hundred dollar payment
00:50:03.000 now that six hundred dollars became nothing but cash flow so even if
00:50:09.720 you have the same expenses
00:50:15.420 coming out it just reduced
00:50:21.240 to forty four hundred dollars which means
00:50:27.480 after the month's end this balance is going to be at ninety four hundred
00:50:33.119 dollars and you've done nothing but just put your income in knock the
00:50:40.079 payment out made that cash flow so every month even if your other expenses stay the
00:50:46.619 same every month this is going to come down 600 a month and you're not doing
00:50:53.460 anything different you're not getting the second job you're not delivering pizzas you're not doing
00:51:00.839 Uber Uber you're not doing Uber you're not you're not doing anything different
00:51:07.760 just putting your money where it serves you so everybody in this whole chat room
00:51:16.140 right now is that what it was called on AOL do we remember the days of AOL
00:51:21.359 can I get like an amen when you would go into the AOL chat room
00:51:26.940 and you'd sit and laugh and talk all night long and then you'd have these AOL meetings where we'd all laugh you know
00:51:34.020 like you go to a restaurant and you'd meet everybody and it was just a big old laffy time does anybody remember the AOL
00:51:42.540 days what happened to them okay anyway
00:51:48.660 good everybody on it remembers it ah it was so much fun
00:51:54.900 wasn't it I had two small children and I would sit in those rooms I had like a cousin and a
00:52:02.099 sister in there and we would laugh till I thought we were going to die at the
00:52:07.920 stuff people would say in those chat rooms and I realized some of them like would go to private rooms and do stupid
00:52:14.640 stuff and all that but we just sitting there and laughed for hours at these
00:52:21.000 crazy people I'm a blessing well thank you so much you're a blessing
00:52:28.440 so um if this
00:52:33.720 I I don't know how to make this any clearer I know that when people first hear this oh I get this every single day
00:52:41.339 how does that knock out your payment well your mind
00:52:47.000 is convinced that we make payments but when you
00:52:54.420 are using a line of credit use it like your checking account just
00:53:00.839 put money in and pull it out as you need it it's um
00:53:06.599 it's the mindset of making payments we think oh we have to make a payment we
00:53:11.819 have to make a payment well you're you're making a payment because you're putting it in here but
00:53:18.180 remember a line of credit is not a loan a credit card is not a loan
00:53:25.920 a credit card is a limit a line of credit a HELOC is a limit that
00:53:33.780 you have been approved for okay so when you've been approved for a limit
00:53:43.740 that means that if I have
00:53:49.260 if I have a twenty thousand dollar truck
00:53:55.319 my balance is twenty thousand dollars and that sucker is costing me six
00:54:00.960 hundred and fifty dollars a month okay so here's a twenty thousand dollar
00:54:09.119 truck payment or this I'm sorry this is a twenty thousand dollar truck loan
00:54:15.059 the payment is six hundred and fifty dollars a month okay
00:54:23.099 I got a HELOC or a line of credit or let's say twenty five thousand
00:54:28.920 dollars which if you've got a home should be very easy to get twenty five thousand uh he a personal line of credit
00:54:36.839 you can go to any credit union nearly and they will give you at least fifteen thousand if you have any kind of credit
00:54:44.460 so let's just say that so this twenty thousand dollar truck
00:54:49.619 loan and let's say you know people are paying up to fifteen percent on uh car loans right now and I'm sorry uh after I
00:54:58.200 picked myself back up back up out of the floor after hearing that because I
00:55:03.359 didn't even realize that they would charge up to 15 on a car loan
00:55:09.420 but they do uh that's a whole nother subject anyway
00:55:14.819 let's act like this one is it the regular 2.5 percent that
00:55:20.579 you know I mean that would be normal three percent but let's just pretend that you said
00:55:27.420 well I have this line of credit but this line of credit is at 15 percent
00:55:35.160 so I really don't think that I want to switch
00:55:41.760 a two and a half percent for a 15 I mean you know it kind of makes sense right
00:55:47.940 like nah we don't want to you don't want to overextend why would you do that why would you take
00:55:54.420 at 15 line of credit over a two and a
00:55:59.520 half percent amortized schedule is anybody in the room know why you
00:56:04.980 would do that well let's see so I take
00:56:11.460 this completely pay it off
00:56:17.640 and put it on the line of credit
00:56:22.980 okay so now there's only five thousand available
00:56:29.880 you have twenty thousand dollars because you have paid off your truck that was really stupid man
00:56:37.140 but you did it it's gone
00:56:42.660 now we have this to deal with
00:56:48.119 why does this make sense why does this make sense
00:56:54.900 well because this person makes five thousand dollars a month
00:57:00.839 and they are going to put it into this HELOC or line of credit
00:57:12.200 and immediately on the first day they no longer have a twenty thousand
00:57:19.140 dollar balance they knocked that thing down to fifteen thousand dollars
00:57:26.819 well like wow right well there are expenses now if you remember
00:57:32.400 in the graph I just had their expenses were two thousand and
00:57:39.180 then 1500 right so it was thirty five hundred total expenses
00:57:45.119 this being a HELOC or a personal line of credit we can put the whole 5 000 income
00:57:50.940 in month one they have 3 500 in expenses but
00:57:58.920 remember what this truck was it was 650 dollars
00:58:06.059 so what does that mean
00:58:16.980 really so if I can do math you all know how I
00:58:23.400 am with math right
00:58:28.819 so did their expenses come down to twenty eight hundred and fifty dollars a
00:58:33.900 month now so 2850 has to be added back in here right
00:58:43.559 so now we're at Seventeen eight fifty after our first month
00:58:51.299 we went from twenty thousand to a seventeen thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars after the first month and
00:58:58.319 we didn't eat beans and rice the whole month and we didn't start delivering pizzas
00:59:07.140 and do Uber and we didn't
00:59:12.180 we didn't like stop feeding the children and we didn't have to sell a child
00:59:20.400 and we didn't have to sell everything extra in our home
00:59:26.460 and we didn't have to drop going to the gym and we can still take karate
00:59:33.240 I mean nothing changed here the only thing that changed is you transferred
00:59:38.760 this twenty thousand into a line of credit at 15 percent
00:59:45.420 got rid of this 650 dollar payment oh let's we'll figure it we'll figure
00:59:51.960 the 15 okay
00:59:59.280 okay so if the twenty thousand dollars sit on this line or an entire year that
01:00:07.559 would be three thousand dollars a year
01:00:14.460 at 15 interest okay
01:00:19.559 so the way we figure interest is we would take the 20K
01:00:25.200 times the interest at 15 percent and that equals
01:00:32.160 three thousand dollars for the year now to get the daily rate that I like to use
01:00:39.660 you would then divide that by 365 days
01:00:49.140 that's eight dollars and 21 cents a day for every day that this sets at twenty
01:00:57.660 thousand dollars how many days is it going to set at twenty thousand dollars
01:01:04.260 maybe none maybe four or five days if you get paid on a Thursday or Friday just as soon as
01:01:11.520 you can get that income into there what's it going to be on seventeen eight fifty
01:01:24.440 7.33 a day okay
01:01:35.339 so let's do it again let's go into month two so our expenses are no longer thirty
01:01:42.359 five hundred they're 28.50 because we no longer have the 650 dollar truck payment
01:01:48.540 that we had before we're going to come in in month two we're going to make another five
01:01:55.140 thousand dollar income deposit or transfer whatever you want to call it a month two oh my gosh look at this
01:02:04.040 twelve thousand eight fifty is going to be a balance until your
01:02:10.980 expenses start coming back in really so let's go ahead and add the expenses
01:02:17.900 28.50 back in
01:02:24.540 we got 17. so we're at fifteen seven hundred
01:02:29.640 so let's go ahead and figure our interest because we don't want to act like it we don't have any
01:02:35.400 so the interest will be
01:02:45.780 say 240 dollars for the first month so we'll put that can you all even see
01:02:52.559 nope you can't see that little can you all right let me move it up here so y'all can see as we're done with this
01:02:57.900 truck alone it got paid off anyway
01:03:03.059 so we're at fifteen seven hundred the interest for the first month was 240
01:03:10.200 approximately remember the bank goes on an average daily balance
01:03:17.460 all right so this is the end of month two let's do
01:03:22.619 month three five thousand income transfer and month
01:03:27.780 three we're at ten thousand nine forty
01:03:33.240 oh my gosh let's figure our interest
01:03:49.319 we're at 158.40 foreign this is our interest
01:03:56.220 we'll go ahead and put that in first
01:04:02.400 and then we're going to add our expenses back in for month three at 28.50
01:04:10.859 so we're at wow you're all if you receive these
01:04:16.140 numbers are wrong do not be prize but I don't do math
01:04:21.180 nor do I want to do math so we're at 13 9 48 kind of going
01:04:27.540 backwards on the board here we all can see everything so at 13 I could write that up higher
01:04:33.660 and have more room so 13 9 48 beginning in the fourth month
01:04:42.119 we're going to bring our five thousand dollar income in this is month four
01:04:51.660 you'll see how we're going down
01:04:59.579 hello L'Oreal uh
01:05:06.599 foreign 89.48
01:05:14.099 in the fourth a month where were we were at twenty thousand dollars
01:05:21.059 four months ago oh and if we would have made four of those truck payments
01:05:30.420 you would have paid twenty six hundred dollars
01:05:37.559 do you see the difference that twenty six hundred dollars did nothing but turn into cash flow to start
01:05:44.339 paying this truck off okay so we're gonna add in our expenses again
01:05:50.220 a 28.50
01:05:56.460 oh here we go me adding again
01:06:01.859 okay
01:06:07.559 did I do something wrong Ten Thousand Eleven thousand adding that
01:06:14.099 in that minus right no okay and then we're going to add our interest again so
01:06:20.700 let's take it off the 13 390 or 9 48
01:06:30.960 foreign so we're at 172 let's say for interest
01:06:39.000 or 10 17. so we're at 11 970.
01:06:47.880 then we're going to come in in month five
01:06:53.160 oh my gosh this thing just keeps going down so we're at income five
01:07:03.660 so we're at 69.70
01:07:09.660 does everybody understanding all of this stuff we went from twenty thousand
01:07:18.599 and now we're in five months and we're down to sixty nine hundred dollars
01:07:31.200 so we're at 6900 we're going to add in our expenses again 28.50
01:07:39.240 foreign
01:07:51.740 98 20 and then we're gonna add our interest again I'm going to take it off the 11 970.
01:08:03.480 so we're at about 150 I'm gonna say
01:08:09.539 so now we're at 99.70
01:08:15.620 99.70 is the balance sorry
01:08:21.359 month six we're going to put in another five thousand
01:08:27.359 income we're at 49.70
01:08:34.620 we're going to add in our expenses at 28.50
01:08:46.339 78 20. foreign comments because I just know that I'm
01:08:52.979 messing up on my ad my adding here somewhere and I'm not catching it so I'm not reading the comments right now
01:09:00.719 so this is your expenses we're going to add in our interest I'm going to take it off of 99.70
01:09:12.600 we are at nope that's not right
01:09:18.779 and 70 times fifteen percent
01:09:24.979 123 approximately and why do I say approximately
01:09:31.560 because I'm figuring it off of the high balance we're at 49.70 and 78 20 it is not going
01:09:39.120 to be 123 dollars a month in interest because they are figuring it on an
01:09:44.399 average daily balance so you would take your high your low and your middle numbers add
01:09:51.779 them together divide by three take that times your interest rate that's how I'm getting I'm I'm getting the 123 off of
01:09:59.580 99.70 but if you wanted a closer average daily balance you could do it that way
01:10:04.739 which it doesn't matter it's still paying down and you're going to be paying less interest that's what matters
01:10:12.060 so we're at 79.43 month seven we're going to do another
01:10:17.940 income deposit we're going to be at 29.43
01:10:25.679 does everybody see where this is going in seven months we've come from a twenty
01:10:32.340 thousand dollar truck balance truck loan balance
01:10:37.440 in seven months we are down to 2943 dollars
01:10:48.659 so at 29.43 we're going to add in the 28.50 for our
01:10:58.020 expenses
01:11:04.739 we're at 57.73 I'm going to add the interest and I'm going to put it off of
01:11:10.320 the 79.43
01:11:17.179 we're at 97 let's just call it 98 make
01:11:23.400 it hard for my adding or at 17.
01:11:30.060 so we're at 58.70 and what does what does month eight do
01:11:37.800 what does month eight do because we're at income seven here
01:11:43.380 we're getting ready to do income eight
01:11:50.340 this is income eight going in
01:11:55.820 871 dollars I would call that paid off
01:12:01.980 in month nine you're going to be more than done you're going to be back to just paying your living expenses out of
01:12:09.659 this account you no longer have a truck payment you no longer have a truck loan
01:12:14.820 you no longer even have a line of credit you've paid it off
01:12:20.340 in less than nine months okay in nine months not less than but in nine
01:12:27.120 months so if you all have any questions about that I might read the comments now that
01:12:33.960 I'm done with my adding I realize I probably made some mistakes I have one
01:12:40.800 video where I made a mistake and very first one like maybe the one of the
01:12:46.920 first um five I had maybe I don't know but I made
01:12:53.159 a mistake in there of one thousand dollars uh just doing subtraction messed
01:12:59.400 it up I can't tell you how many people have called me out on that so I do make mistakes but I'm not taking
01:13:06.780 the video down because I like it let's see what people are saying
01:13:13.260 you're such a blessing thank you cool cat that was cheap entertainment we were
01:13:19.380 talking about AOL a very cheap entertainment at a very good time with that
01:13:24.480 uh should I keep transferring my page a credit card on a weekly basis anytime
01:13:30.600 you can get paid you put it on your line of credit because that will knock down your average daily balance
01:13:38.699 okay if all loans and credit cards are paid off should you go back to putting money into your checking savings account
01:13:45.000 uh Char is that your name I
01:13:50.520 said that you need to invest in yourself invest in yourself a means that you do

01:14:09.360 rest of your life so when you get out of debt heck I use my HELOC to get in more debt

01:14:42.719 um you're going to teach your kids yes gosh please teach the children had I
01:14:48.659 known this at 30 uh wow I mean every one of us in this
01:14:54.840 room if we had been working our money like this whole time we would have no choice but to be millionaires no choice
01:15:01.860 is all the money you're saving uh let me catch up on some stuff here
01:15:12.600 um
01:15:18.420 oh my goodness Gloria you get off the music
01:15:27.480 I turned into an old person when I was young we didn't wear a mask and we used
01:15:32.760 to hang out in the roller rink yeah with good music my sister was talking about
01:15:38.400 going roller skating uh just I think last week great memories there I I don't
01:15:44.699 know why Lionel Richie was always played uh um hello is that what it was hello
01:15:52.980 was always played when I was at the skate rink go figure so now when I walk into a skate rink I just expect them to
01:15:59.940 be playing Lionel Richie um
01:16:08.280 jazz is your favorite jazz is jazz is on here too good for you Gracie
01:16:15.780 jazz is your favorite um let's see what else
01:16:25.260 the graph was great thank you Skye yeah hit the like button definitely
01:16:32.520 I had to rank you 30. here I am what a blessing to make it
01:16:39.120 well thank you Scott Coleman for making it I hope that the information helps
01:16:47.400 yes you should transfer your income whether it be weekly bi-weekly monthly
01:16:52.620 always be transferring into your line of credit because it only brings those
01:16:57.900 balances down makes you happy to see low balances so put it on there when you get
01:17:03.900 paid um cool cat you're such a blessing thank
01:17:10.199 you so much I don't even know what I did am I going back
01:17:15.480 I feel like I'm going back the wrong way I'm reading all this stuff
01:17:20.640 uh yes he's uh Jesus you're so good the
01:17:26.699 Paradigm Shift of looking at the credit card as a bill to looking at it as a checking account where the minimum
01:17:33.300 payment becomes the minimum number of dollars you have to pass through that checking excellent excellent way to say
01:17:41.100 that ah this is revolutionary I can't wait to
01:17:46.920 get my Chevy truck loan well I can't wait for you to get it I hope that you
01:17:52.020 use this right here this is clean comedy yes it is
01:17:57.659 uh and you beat inflation by simply parking your money in a loc it's amazing
01:18:03.000 yes can this work as being a one time a
01:18:08.280 month work check yes anytime you get paid it all works
01:18:13.560 it all works just make sure you are making that payment by the due date because you don't want to go over the
01:18:20.760 due date and you definitely don't want all the stupid charges that they will charge on top of that for penalties and
01:18:27.840 all that fund junk right they're always looking to make money
01:18:34.199 um let's see hello hello L'Oreal you're always so kind every comment you leave
01:18:41.219 me under my videos I see it Beth this is mind-blowing thank you
01:18:48.780 Jesus for understanding are you saying that to Jesus because when you use Jesus
01:18:54.659 you're talking about my Lord or are you talking about Jesus that's on here talking to us
01:19:03.780 um let's see do anyone still confuse Jesus why don't
01:19:09.179 you just start teaching this I mean you're so good at it and like if you were teaching it can you speak Spanish
01:19:15.540 because we really need some Spanish-speaking velocity Bankers out there
01:19:22.080 celebrate Like It's 1999 let's don't even get into the print stuff because you know I'll go there you know I'll go
01:19:29.280 there wow let's see
01:19:38.880 I'm still confused on how this works with mortgage and you still owe monthly mortgage
01:19:46.260 well that's a whole nother live session D because I would have to
01:19:52.380 break that down and I don't think everybody wants to sit on here for another
01:19:57.480 uh that probably take me a little bit to come up with a scenario for a mortgage
01:20:02.580 but absolutely you can use this if you took the twenty thousand that we were
01:20:08.219 showing if you took the 20 000 that we were
01:20:13.739 showing on the loc transferring off to that truck
01:20:18.780 you can do that onto your mortgage and twenty thousand dollars onto a mortgage
01:20:24.300 will save you thousands and thousands of dollars in
01:20:30.480 interest and will cut years and years off of that mortgage so uh
01:20:37.560 if you want a scenario done just on that in
01:20:43.500 another video I do have videos showing how you do that but absolutely that's
01:20:49.500 why you can pay off a home in five to seven years using this that we paid off the truck in nine months
01:20:59.060 line oh yeah Lionel Richie Hello
01:21:08.280 uh I'm always for cash flow so if you have
01:21:13.739 a credit card that has a large payment I always start with the large payment because if you can get a six hundred
01:21:20.880 dollar cash flow using it to pull your expenses out of that that 600 payment
01:21:27.360 turns into 600 cash flow and that is beautiful for paying that card down
01:21:33.300 without doing anything extra uh but what if you do it okay you're
01:21:39.179 talking about pan on two cards you can do that you can pay on two cards at one
01:21:45.120 time doing fifty percent uh and it will save you the payment on
01:21:50.580 both of those cards to do it that way uh it's just that when I like to use one line at a time because you can really
01:21:57.659 see those balances coming down really really fast and then you can transfer over to the next card and you don't have
01:22:04.739 the confusion of you know which expense comes out of which card
01:22:11.280 oh talking about her Lord okay thank you Beth thank you
01:22:16.500 thank you yes okay Skye says what if you have a loan that
01:22:22.560 will only take checking account payments P lock much less than what is owed okay
01:22:29.100 you can still use that P lock even if it's two or five thousand you can still
01:22:35.400 do the transfers into this loan do it just like we've got it set up here and
01:22:42.300 it might take a couple or more months to get that work done and paid off but it'll still work out to be the same
01:22:49.739 payoff okay it's it I would have to like figure that
01:22:55.380 but except for you're going to have to keep
01:23:01.860 making that loan payment that's going to keep taking your cash flow
01:23:08.040 but it'll still work it down so even if you have a line of credit that does not
01:23:14.820 as big as you need for your loan work it down because you can get an
01:23:21.719 increase on a p lock as your credit score goes up and as your balance has come down so yeah
01:23:30.780 let's see what else we got where is the best place
01:23:37.860 to get an loc if your score is below 600 now Celeste
01:23:45.360 you're going to have to if you have a credit card to work with right now you
01:23:50.699 need to just stick with that and do the best you can until you get that credit score up because it's mixing to
01:23:57.360 impossible to be picking up credit when you have such a low credit score
01:24:03.780 so if you have a credit card to start working with as I showed in the start of this video when the graph you can use it
01:24:13.080 um I will post this video where you can watch that graph again and I have a video releasing with my sloppy looking
01:24:20.100 graph that's going to be coming out I want to say it's going to be coming
01:24:26.280 out not this week but next week I don't know what date it's going to be coming
01:24:31.679 out but if you have more questions about that on the way the credit card works
01:24:37.679 and please send me a message and I'll be glad to send you a link before that

01:25:42.900 getting along with each other because there isn't we're all one big team my
01:25:48.659 credit score is around 6 30 what's the minimum to get an loc if you go to a
01:25:54.480 credit union you could probably get a really good shot at getting a p lock through them and it'll probably be even
01:26:01.500 in the form of a credit card through the credit union and you can pull cash off
01:26:08.040 of that credit card and use it as a p lock so check with your credit unions
01:26:14.040 they're really good about giving those P locks um
01:26:19.699 as always Christy you continue to amaze and offer great help while I am still
01:26:25.320 struggling because of my disabilities but I have told all of my children to follow your program as you are a real
01:26:32.699 Lifesaver well that is so precious forever um
01:26:38.900 that's what makes me get up and do this every day is because I want you all to
01:26:45.300 be blessed I want your money to be blessed um by using it right like I said earlier
01:26:52.199 we've got to be good stewards of our money big givers I can't express that enough
01:26:58.340 please be givers yes you need to tithe but you need to give uh the the Bible
01:27:05.699 has so many scripture backing up our giving you have to you have to be a giver
01:27:13.639 you're giving I mean the Bible even says a cast what
01:27:19.739 is it cast your um oh my gosh here I'm trying to quote scripture and I don't have it in front of me
01:27:25.380 um anyway you're supposed to give it everywhere and it'll come back to you in
01:27:31.860 seven ways or something like that I don't know somebody that's on here help me out what is that verse but uh like I
01:27:38.219 said go read second Corinthians 9 if you have any doubt about what your giving
01:27:43.260 does wow I mean it's so clear second Corinthians 9 tells you what
01:27:51.239 you're giving does for your finances and how he gives it back uh there's no way
01:27:57.420 to get out of getting blessed in your giving that's a spiritual law he has
01:28:04.260 that set up for a reason uh in in Genesis he says as long as the Earth re
01:28:09.659 remains there's going to be seed time and harvest so there's going to be planting the seed
01:28:16.380 you wait a little bit and then think of what comes back when you plant a tomato
01:28:22.380 seed how many tomatoes do you get off of that one plant
01:28:27.900 we can't count them there are so many the exact same thing with your giving
01:28:34.340 get serious about your giving you cannot out give God
01:28:40.500 and even if you lend to a needy person he says you have lent to him and he
01:28:46.560 always repays so I could sit here and have a whole nother
01:28:51.900 live on the Lord and how good he is because he is so good and he deserves
01:28:58.560 all of our praise he deserves us to
01:29:04.920 he's just so good to us like can I get an amen anybody out there because he is
01:29:10.500 just a blessing to my life and even in the struggles that I have had
01:29:15.540 which have been ridiculous and many I can look back over my life and see how
01:29:22.800 beautiful he turned that out to be so if you're having a hard time right now keep
01:29:28.860 your chin up it all goes away because the Lord is Blessing you while you're in the mess
01:29:36.360 okay and be thankful you're going through it you're walking through it
01:29:41.820 you're not standing in it you're going through it everything we go through brings
01:29:48.600 like my husband says he says it brings a lesson or a blessing so you decide by doing the right thing
