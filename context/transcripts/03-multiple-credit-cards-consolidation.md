00:00:00.080 so let's talk about this right quick she
00:00:01.760 has a $600 payment right here on
00:00:04.520 American Express that we could fix her
00:00:07.040 cash flow with that if we were just
00:00:09.120 using a credit card in Capital One here
00:00:11.719 see it's at 383 but what she has is a
00:00:15.720 $50,000 line of credit that she
00:00:18.320 currently has $1,100 on so if she has
00:00:23.000 $1,100 already in the balance of this
00:00:25.400 50,000 what if we took the American
00:00:28.279 Express and put it over here and we like
00:00:31.679 I don't know paid that off that would
00:00:33.360 bring her cash flow up to $6.59 what
00:00:36.719 else can we do I say we wipe out all of
00:00:39.120 these little baby ones and probably use
00:00:41.840 this one as her expense card we could do
00:00:45.079 that or we could let this balance work
00:00:47.600 down and then grab that but let's look
00:00:49.960 and see if we add the 525 the 239 15 27
00:00:56.320 66
00:00:57.840 1070 and 1,00
00:01:00.640 that would be
00:01:03.400 4427 so
00:01:06.000 4427 would pay off these okay so we're
00:01:10.200 going to add up actually her expenses
00:01:13.080 would come down all of this except for
00:01:15.640 these two so now she she's just going to
00:01:19.159 have her home which is let me pull her
00:01:22.520 back up her home is 2500 a month and
00:01:28.400 then she would have these two cards so
00:01:31.079 she' have 149 boa and
00:01:35.000 383 Capital One so this would now be her
00:01:38.280 expenses so she's at
00:01:40.520 3,32 now we have to add in her living
00:01:43.479 expenses because she still has to eat
00:01:45.840 she pays her tithe she does all that fun
00:01:47.960 stuff and that's uh
00:01:50.560 2789 she's at
00:01:52.880 5821 so now we no longer have these
00:01:57.320 expenses we have 5821 one okay so what
00:02:01.399 does that mean what does that mean her
00:02:03.320 cash flow is now it's not $659 anymore
00:02:07.119 so if we take her income of
00:02:09.840 6944 and we subtract out the
00:02:13.160 5821 she now has
00:02:17.360 $1,123 for cash flow what did I do to
00:02:20.040 get that nothing just transferred it she
00:02:23.200 didn't get another job and pay this
00:02:24.920 stuff off she just transferred these
00:02:28.120 debts into a line of credit so let's
00:02:30.400 talk about how that's going to work so
00:02:32.080 we're going to add these up so she's got
00:02:35.519 10,527 now in debt on this 50,000 line
00:02:39.080 of credit okay so we'll erase this since
00:02:41.879 we know what her expenses are now let's
00:02:44.760 see what the percentage rate is on okay
00:02:48.760 so it is
00:02:50.760 7.95% on this 50k
00:02:55.800 7.95% and let's see what let's just see
00:02:59.680 what what the
00:03:01.159 7.95% on the
00:03:03.480 10,527 would be times
00:03:07.799 7.95% equals divided by 12 $70
00:03:12.560 approximately that's not bad how much
00:03:14.720 interest was she paying over here on
00:03:16.560 these 500 I mean 5,800 let's see what
00:03:20.159 those were so if she was paying
00:03:23.799 29% on this American Express
00:03:27.360 25% on this Capital One even the Amazon
00:03:32.400 29.99 and so was the Home Depot okay so
00:03:37.200 let's see if if she was paying 29.99 on
00:03:41.040 the
00:03:41.760 1,70 times
00:03:44.480 29.99% she was paying about $27 a month
00:03:48.239 on the Home Depot so I'll write this
00:03:50.480 over here this is going to be our
00:03:52.280 interest so the interest on this one is
00:03:55.439 about $27 a month based on her balance
00:03:58.640 of 10,000 all right 1,70 then the Home
00:04:01.920 Depot is going to be about the same but
00:04:03.879 we'll figure it divided by 12 so she's
00:04:06.720 paying $25 a month oh I've got these
00:04:09.560 switched but they're about the same then
00:04:11.879 let's look what the American Express at
00:04:14.760 29% was
00:04:18.040 $141 okay I won't even go into Capital
00:04:21.798 One look at this $70 on that American
00:04:25.360 Express was 141 by itself I think she's
00:04:29.800 already a winner right because she's
00:04:32.120 already cutting out interest and that
00:04:34.360 alone is a winner okay but now the
00:04:37.039 interest is just $70 at the 7.95% on the
00:04:40.840 10,000 she paid off all of this and she
00:04:43.919 already had ,00 on it so we've just
00:04:46.720 added all this together her interest is
00:04:49.120 $70 we're going to add that in here now
00:04:52.520 so we know now that she's already
00:04:54.639 winning here okay so she's already
00:04:56.960 winning cuz she's saving interest now
00:04:59.000 $10,000 597 with the $70 interest what's
00:05:03.880 our next move what do we do when we do
00:05:06.479 this income goes in
00:05:09.600 6944 income one so we're at
00:05:13.039 10597 subtracting out
00:05:15.639 6944
00:05:18.000 3653 is now her balance after she has
00:05:21.000 done the income transfer so she went
00:05:23.520 from
00:05:25.240 10,527 to
00:05:27.360 3653 the bank will do an average daily
00:05:30.199 balance on what this account's going to
00:05:32.360 be to do this interest to figure what
00:05:35.440 her interest charge is I figured it off
00:05:37.960 of the 10
00:05:39.160 527 what if I did an average between
00:05:42.240 these two what do you think the
00:05:43.479 difference is going to be okay so it
00:05:45.680 really probably be closer to $50 so
00:05:48.720 that's 20 more dollar when this one
00:05:51.720 right here was
00:05:52.960 $141 all by itself so yeah she's a
00:05:55.759 winner just because she's transferred
00:05:57.600 all of that into this line it gave her
00:05:59.680 her this cash flow now her balance is
00:06:02.120 down to
00:06:03.240 3653 she's going to add her expenses of
00:06:06.800 5821 back in cuz she has to eat she has
00:06:10.080 to pay her house payment so these are
00:06:11.960 her expenses so she is at
00:06:16.039 9474 month two we're going to bring this
00:06:19.199 again 6944 can you all see this
00:06:24.039 6944 so
00:06:26.440 9474 subtract out 6944 you've got
00:06:30.599 2530 I don't know guys what do you think
00:06:33.160 what do you think our interest is going
00:06:34.319 to be this month looks like it's going
00:06:36.160 to be pretty low doesn't it okay so
00:06:38.440 let's figure what the interest is going
00:06:40.199 to be now going into the second so if we
00:06:43.759 are at 2530 for a balance we're going to
00:06:47.360 add in some interest so let's average
00:06:49.759 again we'll average between the high and
00:06:51.919 the low get an average just to see where
00:06:54.199 we're at so
00:06:55.720 2530 Plus
00:06:58.520 9474 divided by two so we're at $40 $40
00:07:03.400 for interest what do you guys think
00:07:05.080 about this I mean this is your basic
00:07:07.599 velocity this can work for anybody
00:07:10.319 that's got some debt and then you're
00:07:11.960 just wanting to get all of these credit
00:07:14.319 cards out of this mess put it into a
00:07:17.160 line work it down we are just now in the
00:07:19.919 second month this was income number two
00:07:22.319 this is her second month she was already
00:07:24.400 down here now the second month is in
00:07:27.080 we've added the interest I added month
00:07:29.240 one number interest up here number one's
00:07:31.479 interest is here number two's interest
00:07:33.639 is here okay so this is interest now
00:07:36.599 we're going to add her expenses 5821
00:07:39.479 that includes her house her mortgage
00:07:41.400 that includes all of their food tithe
00:07:43.800 everything
00:07:45.560 5821 expenses we're at $
00:07:48.639 8391 look at here we're going in for
00:07:51.360 month three's income to come in so
00:07:54.159 income three
00:07:56.159 6944 so
00:07:58.440 1,44 $7 what do you think one more month
00:08:02.720 she's going to be out of this debt now
00:08:04.879 we didn't count this card because this
00:08:07.080 could be used for her expense card and
00:08:09.960 if this is used for her her expense card
00:08:12.560 guess what that 383 becomes cash flow
00:08:15.240 now right so she could be knocking this
00:08:18.560 down while she's finishing this if you
00:08:22.319 play the game right I wouldn't mess with
00:08:24.400 this one because it's a
00:08:25.919 0% and when a a credit card is at a 0% I
00:08:29.879 would just pay the minimum payment but
00:08:32.919 this one is at
00:08:34.320 25% so when we get done she could go
00:08:37.080 ahead and grab it hey how about if we
00:08:39.200 just go ahead and grab that and pull
00:08:40.599 that in here this 11,000 let's just go
00:08:43.640 ahead and do that cuz she's almost got
00:08:46.399 this off what does that do to her cash
00:08:48.959 flow takes it back up to 383 or adds the
00:08:52.480 383 in or cash flow is now
00:08:57.399 $1,556 oh my she's going to be happy
00:09:00.600 with this board and I know it so 5821
00:09:03.920 subtract out the 383 would be her new
00:09:07.160 expenses are now
00:09:09.640 5438 guys this is the way you do this
00:09:12.519 okay you have to realize that we're just
00:09:16.160 using the wrong instruments that the
00:09:18.440 bank offers you're just using the wrong
00:09:20.480 instruments if you're sitting in loans
00:09:22.800 or in you're letting balances set on
00:09:24.880 credit cards you need to get a line of
00:09:26.880 credit you need to just move everything
00:09:28.720 into the line
00:09:29.959 so that you can work that debt off you
00:09:32.680 can gain all of this cash flow and now
00:09:34.839 it's paying off your account so let's go
00:09:36.880 ahead and do this 12 4 47 we're going to
00:09:41.000 Let's see we need to add some more
00:09:42.399 interest so let's do it off of the high
00:09:44.800 and the low okay I'll just do it right
00:09:46.720 here
00:09:47.480 $46 that is all the interest that is the
00:09:51.079 average so she's at
00:09:53.200 $14.93 we're going to add her expenses
00:09:55.680 though
00:09:56.600 5438 cuz she's got to eat so
00:10:00.240 12 493 +
00:10:04.440 5438
00:10:06.680 17
00:10:08.640 931 okay so 17
00:10:12.240 931 we've already added the interest
00:10:14.880 we've already taking out the expenses
00:10:16.959 this paid off the Capital One all right
00:10:20.160 let's put in the income again what month
00:10:22.480 is this income number four so her fourth
00:10:25.800 month
00:10:27.040 17931 - 694 4 is
00:10:31.839 10,987 let's add some interest we'll add
00:10:35.360 her expenses
00:10:37.279 5438 for month four let's add some
00:10:40.519 interest so we'll take the high and the
00:10:42.560 low here plus
00:10:44.590 [Music]
00:10:45.800 17931 / 2 *
00:10:49.720 7.95% ID 12 so
00:10:52.760 $96 approximately for interest because
00:10:55.839 we paid off that so that took her
00:10:58.720 balance back up here so we're at 96 I
00:11:01.320 think I figured the interest a little
00:11:02.639 early here before but that's okay we
00:11:04.639 averaged it out we're good everybody
00:11:06.480 relax we're good 54 38 10 987 so we're
00:11:10.920 at 16
00:11:13.040 521 here we go we're do the 6944 again
00:11:17.600 income number five so
00:11:20.760 9577 so we'll do the expenses for month
00:11:24.320 five let's figure some interest again
00:11:27.360 we'll do on the high and the low
00:11:30.760 16521
00:11:32.360 $87
00:11:34.720 interest these are expenses let me put
00:11:37.480 the expenses here for anybody trying to
00:11:39.399 keep notes can you all still see are we
00:11:41.000 good okay let's see what we are we're
00:11:43.480 running out of room
00:11:45.800 9577 plus 54 38 expenses and 87 in
00:11:50.680 interest is
00:11:52.880 15102 and we're going to do the income
00:11:55.399 again
00:11:56.560 6944 income number six so so 6 months
00:12:00.360 she's wiped out all of her credit cards
00:12:03.000 except this 0% we're going to just be
00:12:05.680 paying that because we want to keep the
00:12:08.720 0% it's not charging us interest this
00:12:11.120 over here is charging a little bit of
00:12:12.600 baby interest
00:12:14.440 8158 is her balance at the end of month
00:12:17.800 six so let's just figure what we're
00:12:20.399 looking at to finish that off about
00:12:23.320 almost six more months so within the
00:12:25.399 year less than a year she will be paid
00:12:28.480 off so that means that she paid off
00:12:31.839 10,527 plus the 11,000 so she paid off
00:12:36.720 21,
00:12:39.160 527 in less than 12 months not doing
00:12:43.800 anything different she just rearranged
00:12:46.079 her money a little bit she decided to
00:12:48.079 start putting the money where it serves
00:12:49.720 her instead of making all these little
00:12:51.440 payments with all of this interest so
00:12:53.839 paid off
