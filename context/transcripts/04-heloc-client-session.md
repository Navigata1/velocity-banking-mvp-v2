00:00:00.780 let's talk about your income which I mean your this is your HELOC that we're going to
00:00:07.560 start with your beginning balance 36 475 but first let's talk about your income
00:00:15.480 what is your monthly income
00:00:24.980 5076 and then give me your total expenses
00:00:37.260 okay start with that a second and then we'll
00:00:43.440 get your cash flow okay
00:00:50.150 [Music] yeah okay good so you're negative 365
00:01:00.840 okay but you have the HELOC
00:01:06.180 which is the game changer and it was 36 475
00:01:11.820 yes yes okay that's your current balance okay so when you start with the HELOC
00:01:21.000 um which it's got a 38 000 limit on it that you can use
00:01:29.880 you're going to work this one down a little bit I noticed that you didn't have a payment on this showing
00:01:39.720 on your worksheet
00:01:47.820 okay what how much is the payment
00:01:54.899 okay all right so this 365 is going to be taken into a
00:02:03.360 positive when you start using this account correctly okay so your income is going to go in
00:02:14.700 that knocks that out because the income transfer satisfies the payment
00:02:29.940 so your balance will be at 31 399
00:02:35.100 [Music] okay
00:02:40.379 so what we have to determine is what you're going to do after you start doing
00:02:46.080 this because you need a little bit of cash flow to start making a difference
00:02:51.480 on the balance so that you can start working off the debt so with the U.S Bank that you currently
00:02:58.739 have you could you could use the U.S Bank as
00:03:03.900 your expense card so that would help you to take the 346 and turn it into cash flow
00:03:12.000 as well are you doing that currently no I haven't started really anything yet
00:03:20.040 okay okay
00:03:29.700 yes so let's look at your expenses and we'll talk about that
00:03:35.580 so you have marked as twenty five hundred dollars is
00:03:41.760 what you can actually pay with a credit card so you have
00:03:48.970 [Music]
00:03:58.739 with a huge A Healer okay except the loan
00:04:05.459 you can't put loans on if you're done with this sheet okay
00:04:11.459 so I'll just I'll name everything except
00:04:17.639 um maybe I'll move the camera here so I can put the list here and you can see
00:04:23.220 what we're actually listing
00:04:30.360 okay so this is what you can actually use for your credit card for
00:04:38.040 the electric which you've got at 118
00:04:44.639 the internet
00:04:51.120 at 45 gas
00:04:58.380 193. cable
00:05:09.180 120 I guess daycare
00:05:16.620 with daycare
00:05:22.139 8.50 does the private school go on a credit
00:05:28.919 card
00:05:35.639 cool
00:05:42.240 3 30.
00:05:48.060 gym membership
00:05:55.979 52.
00:06:02.580 um marketing business probably business insurance probably
00:06:10.270 [Music] so um I think that business insurance is
00:06:16.979 supposed to come from a checking okay I'll just put business and put 75. okay
00:06:28.259 um car insurance would be yes car insurance 190.
00:06:36.720 and the rest are credit cards so right okay so let's add this up
00:06:43.680 to 118 45 193.
00:06:49.220 120 8.50 30 30 52.
00:06:57.300 75 190. so
00:07:04.520 1973 dollars can go on a credit card for expenses
00:07:11.160 okay now is this is going to be every month until I get
00:07:16.259 this paid down because we already used all of the income
00:07:21.840 right so if I put 1973
00:07:28.199 that's gonna building okay
00:07:34.440 so let me discuss how that works so we went over what is actually going to go
00:07:40.860 on to the credit card when the due date comes due you're going
00:07:48.000 to put the total amount that we came up with with which was the 19
00:07:54.319 73. so the 1973 are the credit card expenses
00:08:02.039 that can be charged all right then your payment
00:08:08.940 what is the payment that you have on that card
00:08:15.440 is 350. so the U.S payment card is 350.
00:08:22.560 so you're at well yeah
00:08:29.039 13 so 23 23 is the amount that will go
00:08:34.679 on the U.S bank card every month okay so what this does is with the U.S Bank
00:08:45.060 what is your what's your balance on the U.S bank right now
00:08:54.480 okay so your U.S
00:08:59.860 [Music] no that's okay we want to use the full
00:09:05.220 card because the point of using the credit card is to work the balance down on it
00:09:12.779 while we're working the balance down on this HELOC okay
00:09:18.300 now you can do nothing but put in your 1973.
00:09:24.660 but as you're putting in the 1973 onto this twelve thousand dollar balance
00:09:31.560 that is going to reduce this balance but you're going to have interest come back and so you need something in my mind to
00:09:39.720 defeat the interest in this account as well okay
00:09:45.300 so when you're putting in your credit card expenses at 1973 plus the payment
00:09:51.480 you currently have you're at 23 23 which means
00:10:00.000 what is your interest on this card
00:10:05.400 [Music] 25 percent
00:10:11.220 25 interest
00:10:21.080 96.77 is your balance after you do your income transfer so this is income one
00:10:28.380 let's let's
00:10:36.540 all right [Music] okay we're getting there so hold on okay
00:10:43.440 so I get that question a lot where am I getting the income if I'm putting the income into this credit card okay
00:10:51.000 so let's do the 96.77
00:10:57.000 plus your twelve thousand and
00:11:02.339 divide that by two that gives us 6 000
00:11:09.000 average no it doesn't what did it just do hold on so we're
00:11:15.000 dividing the 96 70 no no we're adding I'm sorry that's what I did we're adding
00:11:20.760 the 9677 plus the 12 000
00:11:27.540 divide that by two
00:11:33.180 okay what the hell 96 77 plus 12
00:11:39.899 000. divided by two there we go ten thousand eight thirty eight
00:11:46.200 times 25 percent divided by 12. so your interest so your
00:11:53.640 interest would be two hundred and twenty six dollars approximately
00:11:58.860 on this which is
00:12:07.800 your balance would be 99 99.03 after you add in the interest
00:12:15.540 so that's what the 350 here is going to combat is your interest to keep it down
00:12:21.899 while bringing the balance down on this card as well okay now the income
00:12:28.140 transfer that you just asked about that is coming out of your HELOC
00:12:33.720 so all of your income goes into your HELOC and all of your expenses come out
00:12:39.600 so when your income goes in on the due date of this credit card your payment's
00:12:45.120 going to come directly out of the HELOC so all expenses will come out of here
00:12:52.320 then you will pay this on the due date so you're revolving both accounts
00:12:58.200 does that make sense right
00:13:06.480 and then we're saying the expenses
00:13:13.320 so for example let me just dumb it down for myself you're fine
00:13:19.019 so for the expenses like the electric right the 180 instead of paying
00:13:25.200 electric company directly I'm going to charge it to my credit card
00:13:30.959 and move that money from the HELOC to the credit card right right yes
00:13:37.139 I Circle that so I think you said that when the income
00:13:42.180 goes in here you're going to let everything sit until this credit card's due then you're going to pull it out and
00:13:49.320 pay the credit card right yes and I would have
00:13:54.380 charged the actual expenses to the credit card yes because you're getting cash rewards I'm sure and we want the
00:14:02.459 cash rewards so you put all of your expenses that you can onto the credit card which will pay you back cash
00:14:09.540 rewards which offsets your interest a little bit okay
00:14:17.579 I think I got it it is a lot because we are in a new strategy so you're used to just making
00:14:24.959 payments when you're looking at a strategy to save all the interests that you can save
00:14:31.579 you try to kill two birds with one stone by one your income's taking care of this
00:14:38.959 two your income is also coming into here taking care of this so your
00:14:46.519 effectively killing interest on both while you're gaining cash rewards that
00:14:52.380 is going to do nothing but help you pay this card down as well
00:14:57.600 okay that's I'm gonna have to it is a whole new way of thinking because I'm like just shifting around things to make
00:15:05.579 it work for me better but it is a it is a new way to think but
00:15:11.519 I need to learn a way to teach it so that when people hear it a light bulb
00:15:18.060 goes off immediately because I get that a lot it's not just you it's dealing
00:15:23.399 with people that have been in the old system of just making payments we don't even think about the interest
00:15:30.120 because well interest just is and you know it comes with having the bill so if
00:15:36.839 we can get into our heads that wait a minute I'm avoiding interest because
00:15:42.060 every dime of Interest I can avoid is actually going to pay me back because
00:15:47.880 I'm working off the debt faster so when you're so when you're looking at
00:15:53.760 the cash rewards that is nothing but a strategy in itself to get you money back
00:15:59.699 so that you can work down your own debt okay
00:16:08.100 where are we at
00:16:18.800 right right and then that
00:16:24.180 when the credit card is due right then I'm going to put the 23
00:16:30.060 23. right right into the credit card right
00:16:35.160 charge my expenses to the credit card right so you will get used to that that is
00:16:42.480 just something it takes it takes a little bit of time but this credit card
00:16:47.839 needs to be your source for food gas everything you can put on it because at
00:16:54.720 the end of the month when that bill comes due they're just going to bill you for your minimum payment you are going
00:17:02.579 to know what expenses just by printing off your credit card statement you can see what expenses that I put on this
00:17:09.480 card this month that is what comes out of this account so you're keeping this
00:17:15.540 one lowering all the time you're keeping this one at Bay by
00:17:21.299 keeping your income going into it okay okay
00:17:30.660 the 370 which yes and
00:17:35.700 I'm so eliminated
00:17:41.160 right so we stopped making payments and now we've turned this into cash flow
00:17:46.980 that is actually bringing that balance down every month got it okay okay all right so if you're
00:17:54.120 done with this I'll erase this off and we'll go back to this
00:18:00.059 okay all right so we know so we know now that the 23 23
00:18:07.620 is going to come back out just to hit your credit card so this is your credit
00:18:13.020 card expense then we're going to take the 23 23 from
00:18:18.539 your actual subtracting this of course because we're this is now satisfied so
00:18:25.440 due to this is satisfied with that income transfer we can deduct it off of the 5441 so we'll go ahead and do that
00:18:35.580 because that's no longer considered a payment
00:18:47.700 that's 5071 that are actually expenses now then
00:18:53.280 we're going to subtract this 23 23 because I'm just showing you a
00:19:00.179 visual of what this is going to look like in your month
00:19:07.860 so you're at 27.48 this is getting crowded but we'll
00:19:13.559 add 27.48 in expenses that will come out of
00:19:20.460 this account so this is your mortgage any other credit card payments or loan
00:19:25.860 payments that you have okay so we add those back in
00:19:41.880 so 36 470 is your balance
00:19:47.700 now you see what's happening because you only have five dollars of cash flow when
00:19:53.520 you put your income in you pull your expenses back out you're you're at 470
00:19:59.640 but now you have interest on this account as well so that's why you're
00:20:05.100 going to have to cut expenses or gain more income to work this balance down as
00:20:12.299 well and so we're working off of
00:20:19.320 my income as my husband's is very seasonal it's very choppy there can be four months
00:20:26.340 where he does he doesn't okay so my plan
00:20:36.419 and then he would bring in
00:20:43.620 this okay and just
00:20:51.780 right okay
00:20:58.799 okay you know a great month and we have
00:21:06.000 four thousand dollars to throw at something outside of our savings
00:21:12.240 that's what we're gonna do okay I guess that was my other question is um
00:21:21.840 when it comes to [Music] um
00:21:29.159 when you're trying to do this right do you typically have people try to keep
00:21:37.740 a thousand dollar emergency fund or six months I always hear different things well what I do or did while I was
00:21:46.380 working off debt was I used the credit card and the thousand dollars that's in
00:21:53.100 this line as my emergency fund because in the event anything happens medically
00:22:00.500 Car Wise and Appliance breaks down you can use your credit card right
00:22:07.559 yeah okay so I considered any lines of credit that I had that I was not using
00:22:15.000 which are several credit cards that you have you would consider that that's
00:22:20.520 going to be my emergency fund in the event I have anything happen that I have got to take care of
00:22:28.440 okay so I don't
00:22:34.500 first of all we're a credit system cash is fading out they are making that
00:22:41.100 they're making Cash go away it's just a matter of time and of course what's
00:22:46.260 happened this month has pushed that even closer to happening and from
00:22:52.440 um sources I hear that Biden signed in
00:22:57.480 even more evading the cash out so
00:23:02.820 it's a it's a matter of time to till I think it's a matter of time until cash
00:23:08.940 is completely eliminated from society kind of where there's no other option
00:23:15.780 but to use credit yeah so I think that
00:23:21.240 building our credit is so important because
00:23:26.640 that's how they're going to control us Okay so
00:23:33.000 if we have what we can do all we can do is have our credit ready
00:23:39.659 be out of debt as much as possible and in good standing so that hopefully you
00:23:46.020 know we will have something too savings and do whatever that is your prerogative but I don't usually mess with it so if
00:23:53.580 you and your husband want to save uh go for it I don't mind that at all and and
00:23:59.039 it's not going to affect your scenario as long as you can get into a positive cash flow
00:24:04.440 yeah okay so the idea is is that when your husband uh gets his seasonal pay
00:24:10.860 that you're going to throw all of that into this HELOC which will then work out
00:24:16.980 any negatives that you might fall into on the months he doesn't have cash flow
00:24:22.559 is that what you're saying thanks
00:24:31.980 you know for those for those four months okay
00:24:40.640 [Music] so he's into Landscaping we are right
00:24:46.440 now of instability with the economy even a HELOC can be frozen you know in the
00:24:52.919 event of the market fails in one way or the other so
00:24:58.620 please you never know what a bank is going to do so in a situation where you and your
00:25:05.220 husband are him working seasonally in that situation and you can dump money
00:25:12.600 into this thing when he is working percent
00:25:18.539 eight
00:25:25.140 we're going to go into the negative just using your income
00:25:31.380 what on average does your husband make when he works
00:25:43.700 thirty six hundred month on the low end okay
00:25:50.039 before taxes trying to think um comes out of
00:25:58.980 savings is so you won't see the car payments on my
00:26:05.640 license okay because
00:26:10.980 okay okay
00:26:17.940 okay so if your husband can allocate approximately six hundred dollars per
00:26:22.980 month yeah I I think that would
00:26:28.740 help to bring that down right I'm just wondering
00:26:36.240 when it comes to like using the card for the expenses versus using the HELOC
00:26:53.159 the benefit there saying the US
00:26:58.740 making up for real okay so let's look at that credit card again so it's twelve thousand
00:27:05.820 dollar balance currently and you said it 25 percent
00:27:18.860 because that's the largest balance and the highest interest right right so 25
00:27:24.020 you're paying eight dollars and 21 cents a day for every day that this sits at twelve
00:27:31.020 thousand dollars so if you're 77
00:27:37.919 balance
00:27:49.200 so every day that you're leaving it at the 96.77 you're paying
00:27:54.500 6.62 cents a day so how that matters is so this 30-day
00:28:02.820 period so this in 30 days is 198.20
00:28:15.419 this is 246 30.
00:28:20.820 so you're saving about fifty dollars
00:28:25.980 a month in interest alone by doing your income transfer in
00:28:33.659 okay now for every day they sit so if it's twelve thousand one day and 96.77
00:28:40.919 the next and then your expenses start coming out you're going it depends on
00:28:46.279 what they say you're at I mean if you want to win you have to
00:28:51.419 buy that
00:29:01.080 plus plus if they give you even a one percent right now
00:29:08.100 yeah yeah I mean it's about looking for saving interest any way possible and
00:29:14.279 that is a definite way to save the interest your income your income
00:29:19.559 transfer into this account is going to save you interest that's the whole point of putting all of your income into here
00:29:26.460 you paid on your principal to pay off the debt yeah so with your husband
00:29:31.799 having an average of six hundred dollars a month that he can throw into this account you're going to be working down
00:29:39.480 the account a lot faster yeah so the two you know
00:29:45.659 the 600 subtract out the 243 is literally going to be coming off of your
00:29:51.960 principal every month so then at what point would you start transferring in like the credit cards
00:29:59.520 once I have like twelve thousand dollars worth of room on the HELOC no I would I
00:30:07.020 would work this down for about six months then I would turn around and put some on a debt
00:30:14.340 now I don't like I tell you what I don't like is leaving your lines of credit at
00:30:19.559 the limit so with your HELOC you would probably it looks like you have more value in your
00:30:26.340 home than what this 38 thousand dollars is so
00:30:32.340 what the banks do is if you have um if you have a two hundred thousand
00:30:39.360 dollar home and you know the 80 percent um say the 80 percent is what they would
00:30:46.799 give you as far as equity in your home then you subtract off what your current
00:30:52.679 balance is on the mortgage what I try to do is keep it to where my HELOC
00:30:59.640 is low enough that the value in my home that if the value in my home were to
00:31:05.520 drop you know 30 percent is the HELOC plus the mortgage going to
00:31:12.600 be less than whatever that value is at that time they let's say they cut the limit down
00:31:19.919 to what the value of your home is now then you're okay because you're ready
00:31:26.039 for that you know just so that we protect ourselves we make sure that
00:31:31.080 we're keeping our limits on our helocs especially down as low as we can possibly get it so
00:31:38.880 with me saying that you may want to work this down for the
00:31:43.919 rest of the year see where you're at and take a thousand or two throw it into a
00:31:49.380 debt then rather than pile it back up to the thirty six thousand dollar limit okay
00:31:56.039 just to just to protect yourself but the point is is just
00:32:03.000 you know the banks fell and that's a given insurance companies in the last 220 some
00:32:11.100 years have not failed so these policies are as close to
00:32:16.260 security as we're going to get with somewhere to put our money that
00:32:21.860 we've got a little bit of hope that you know it's going to be okay with them I'm
00:32:28.200 not putting cash in a bank and letting it sit there I'm just not doing it I don't trust what the what could end up
00:32:34.679 happening with that so yeah
00:32:41.820 absolutely it's four doesn't six percent growth and guaranteed growth
00:32:48.240 if you're in a mutual fund you're also getting dividends so it's just
00:32:53.820 um I don't know I just think it's a win-win and it's the closest thing that we've got to any kind of security in the
00:33:00.059 world when it comes to saving money so then what I'll do is I'll pay that
00:33:05.460 down and I'll throw whatever I can from Patrick's income
00:33:11.760 to the HELOC see where we are in six months okay
00:33:18.840 um it's like
00:33:32.820 like small credit cards like if you have a three thousand dollar
00:33:38.519 where I'm like sweet we have all three thousand that we that we then are put towards the HELOC I feel like
00:33:45.179 the HELOC Interest being at eight and being hired
00:33:54.720 okay so remember the banks go on an average
00:34:00.419 daily balance so when we put every dime we can get into that HELOC first you have knocked
00:34:08.399 the balance down turn around in a day or turn around in a day or two and pay off
00:34:13.859 the credit cards just as long as it hits your line of credit first to drop that
00:34:19.859 balance you're killing two birds with one stone
00:34:25.739 perfect see and I never thought of that yeah well
00:34:32.040 it just takes years of thinking about it all of a sudden you think of things you
00:34:37.800 never thought of before so when you're when you're setting your strategy up more things are going to come up to you
00:34:44.460 because you're going to think oh my gosh if I do this then I'm going to save a little bit here and then I can just you
00:34:49.918 know I mean you're always thinking outside the box because we have been put in a mindset we're born into it
00:34:59.040 so when you step outside of the box and you look around and you're like oh well
00:35:04.440 you know I could do this here for you know even a month or two will save me some money if I can
00:35:11.520 throw the money from my HELOC into my whole life then pull it back out and use
00:35:17.040 it my whole life is built up for the year and I don't have to worry about putting in any more deposits this year
00:35:23.220 into it now just pull it and use it for this over here your mind is always thinking about
00:35:29.760 some other way that you can be gaining money saving money making passive income
00:35:37.140 you need to always be thinking like that because we've lived we've lived in the
00:35:42.240 payments I mean I don't know how long you've had this HELOC sitting at 36 000 but they're ripping you 243 dollars for
00:35:50.400 every day that sits there and to know that your credit card is the same interest and you're letting it sit at
00:35:57.599 twelve thousand that's you know if if you if you could get a zero percent credit card I would
00:36:04.980 tell you you need to be getting a zero percent credit card transferring your balances into there until you get this
00:36:11.880 HELOC under control and then you can start paying off your other debt
00:36:17.660 [Music] to look for
00:36:26.880 um credit cards cards Bank of America is doing really good on zero percent credit cards right now you can check with them
00:36:35.520 um but you know if you Google zero percents they'll pop up but I know
00:36:42.060 Bank of America they're being really good to work with right now I'm not real sure why but I just know they are
00:36:49.980 I think we are at time so I want to
00:36:56.820 just thank you all right for your time I appreciate it thank you for reaching out
00:37:02.280 and I hope that we're good
00:37:12.480 good I'm glad because with your husband's income I'm not worried about the line of credit I think that you've
00:37:18.660 got it under control I just think you are you're trying to do it all on your income and you're getting very very
00:37:24.599 close but you still lack that interest on this HELOC so once you get some of
00:37:31.140 your husband's money in there that will help start knocking that balance down as well
00:37:37.200 um you know if you were having thirty six hundred dollar months and you at least and you throw it into the HELOC
00:37:43.380 well you're going to be out of that thing in no time what 10 months about 10 months
00:37:54.359 yeah yeah so you think about it if your husband has eight good months of just
00:38:01.140 the 3600 a month that you can throw in there uh you're done with this line
00:38:06.440 you've literally paid off your debt and you're just working the line down again
00:38:11.700 that's literally what you need to be looking at because that needs to be your goal is throw your husband's money in
00:38:19.440 there get that thing down get your debt gone and then when he's on his four
00:38:25.920 month of sabbatical or whatever you want to call it you don't have anything to worry about
00:38:31.079 you can live off of the line and feel very good about it
00:38:46.090 [Music] right and then I make the payment s right well that's what they want you
00:38:53.520 to do because when that sits in savings they can use it as their own money and
00:38:58.859 then when it's sitting in savings they're charging you this because you
00:39:04.200 don't put it where it serves you you're putting it where it serves them
00:39:09.300 right of course so it takes a little bit because you
00:39:14.880 know everybody I talked to in a day which is a lot of people I mean I can't
00:39:20.640 even tell you how many people I touch in a day maybe a hundred or more through
00:39:26.220 emails through comments through appointments and every one of them are
00:39:31.440 just like you it takes time it takes about three months for you to get the
00:39:36.599 concept Concrete in your mind or you're comfortable with your strategy and then you you set up safeguards for
00:39:44.760 yourself in the event they freeze my HELOC what am I going to live on figure it out I mean we literally have
00:39:52.619 to be thinking a step ahead of them because the ranks and they can absolutely stop anything they want to
00:39:59.339 stop when they want to stop it so we're thinking ahead we're like hey if they cut cash out tomorrow I want my credit
00:40:06.960 built I want to be ready whatever they throw at me I want to be ready
00:40:12.780 so that I'm not going to be in absolute turmoil when it happens
00:40:18.119 you can pay everything whenever because you're going to have the line to live
00:40:23.400 off of and you're no longer worried about when the stuff's coming out you're setting it up on automatic you put your
00:40:30.359 check in transfer it over when you get paid and forget about it literally it is
00:40:35.760 the most wonderful life you could ever live because you are used to okay it's payday I gotta sit down I gotta pay this
00:40:42.960 pay that pay this nope I have it set up automatically it's coming out of my HELOC
00:40:48.780 transfer income in I'm done
00:40:58.800 yeah but I'll get there I was literally bored I was literally bored when I first set
00:41:06.119 up everything because I had been so intense on debt to making sure I wasn't late on payments making sure I didn't
00:41:14.160 have checks bouncing throughout the day or didn't have things coming in and my account was empty I mean every day it
00:41:21.960 was a struggle I ever had a computer at my work I was constantly looking at my
00:41:27.119 account to see what's happened oh my gosh did that come in I hope I can catch it I hope I can get my check over there before you know and when I set it up to
00:41:35.760 where everything was automatic everything was flowing I just had to make sure that
00:41:41.640 when I got paid I was putting it in the bank and throwing it into that line it was
00:41:47.520 like oh my gosh I remember sitting around thinking what am I going to think about or what
00:41:52.800 what do I do because I felt like I was born because I didn't have that to think about it was almost
00:42:00.839 it was almost discouraging because it was like okay wow okay what I think about that's what I want kids with our
00:42:08.099 kids that's what I want people to get away from is because then we can focus on our kids we can focus on what they're
00:42:15.000 wanting to do or you know what I want to do around the house or whatever you know
00:42:20.400 I can buy that new refrigerator I've been needing for 10 years because I haven't had the money to buy it but now
00:42:26.700 I have credit so I'm gonna go buy the refrigerator because I know how to work it down now
00:42:33.960 yeah I think so I would just set up the expenses
00:42:42.180 um
00:42:47.339 well I don't hear screaming so I know I was gonna say that somebody die
00:42:58.520 yes and then [Music] foreign
00:43:22.980 yes you're good yes yes and then everything is set up automatically yes
00:43:36.599 exactly exactly
