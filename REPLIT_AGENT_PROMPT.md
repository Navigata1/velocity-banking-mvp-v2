# Replit Agent Prompt (paste into Replit AI)

Read `replit.md` first.

Goal: ship a working browser demo **tonight** (Next.js + TS + Tailwind in `apps/web/`) with routes:
- `/` Car Dashboard
- `/simulator`
- `/cockpit`
- `/learn`
- `/vault` (integrate wealth-transfer-timeline component from prototypes)

Must include:
- user inputs
- baseline vs strategy outputs
- cash flow, interest/day, debt-free ETA
- warnings: cash flow <= 0, LOC utilization > 80%
- calm coach tone + “Educational tool. Not financial advice.”

Keep scope tight. No auth. No bank integrations.
