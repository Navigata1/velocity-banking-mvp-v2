# InterestShield Mission Journal

## 2026-07-13T01:38Z - session 1 kickoff
- Bootstrapped Mission Control from the July 12 State of the Union using inline execution with a cooling-off refutation pass.
- Confirmed the mission starts at P0 Release Truth; Vercel authentication and domain ownership are the first external gates.
- Next: merge this heartbeat, then inspect Vercel project state and promote only the verified green main artifact.

## 2026-07-13T01:45Z - P0 baseline gates recorded
- Passed P0-G1 through P0-G3: 238 regressions, accessibility contract, production build, and seven local routes.
- P0-G4 failed on the expected stale public marker; evidence names the green dfb4d91 deployment target and exact promotion commands.
- No production state was changed before the target and rollback facts were recorded.

## 2026-07-13T01:50Z - bootstrap PR merged, P1 activated
- PR #216 merged at b73e773 after two GitHub CI runs and Vercel preview checks passed.
- P0-T1 is parked as an external auth blocker: connector OAuth grant expired and CLI has no local credentials.
- Activated P1 so the independent financial correctness work continues; next is the canonical LOC ledger continuity fix under TDD.
