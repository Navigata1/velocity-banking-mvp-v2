## Core premise
Velocity banking is not “magic.” It’s a **cash-flow and interest-timing system**:
- Income hits a revolving balance first (LOC/HELOC) to reduce the interest basis
- Expenses are routed intentionally (cash vs expense card vs sweep)
- Cash flow is the main lever that reduces principal and accelerates payoff
