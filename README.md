# Velocity Banking MVP Spec Pack (Car → House → Vault)

## Core premise
Velocity banking is not “magic.” It’s a **cash-flow and interest-timing system**:
- Income hits a revolving balance first (LOC/HELOC) to reduce the interest basis
- Expenses are routed intentionally (cash vs expense card vs sweep)
- Cash flow is the main lever that reduces principal and accelerates payoff

> Building software and education tools. It is not financial advice.
