# Design References

## dashboard-reference.png
This image is a **UI inspiration reference** for the VelocityBank MVP demo.

Use it as a guide for:
- calm, “wellness dashboard” feel
- card-based layout
- clear numeric vitals
- generous spacing + rounded corners
- minimal, non-scary visual language

### How to use in the Replit demo
If you're building a Next.js web demo, you can optionally copy this file into:
- `apps/web/public/design/dashboard-reference.png`

Then you can view it in-browser at:
- `/design/dashboard-reference.png`

(Or add a `/design` route that displays the image + layout notes.)

### Cockpit Mode
There is no cockpit reference image included yet; use a “pilot cockpit / instrument cluster” layout:
- 2–3 rows of gauges
- large “Airspeed (Cash Flow)” and “Fuel Burn (Interest/Day)”
- minimal chrome; keep it calm and readable
