00:00:00.120 hello and welcome back to my channel I
00:00:02.100 am Christy van with fantastic finances
00:00:04.319 and on this channel I teach velocity
00:00:06.240 banking today I wanted to talk about
00:00:08.519 mortgages I am getting clients coming to
00:00:11.760 me about every week now saying hey we
00:00:14.820 bought a home and we have a seven
00:00:17.820 percent interest charge so when I hear
00:00:21.300 that I want to get down in a fetal
00:00:23.460 position on the floor and just cry out
00:00:27.660 loud for you
00:00:29.519 and I want to explain to you when they
00:00:33.239 say to you oh go get you a little four
00:00:36.780 percent mortgage
00:00:38.940 don't pay a 12 line of credit let's go
00:00:42.360 get a little four percent mortgage I
00:00:44.640 wonder if you know what they're saying a
00:00:47.100 four percent mortgage
00:00:51.780 what does that really equal
00:00:54.539 well
00:00:55.800 take four times two that equals eight
00:01:00.000 right
00:01:01.079 mm-hmm
00:01:02.399 now add a zero to that
00:01:06.900 you are paying 80 percent interest on a
00:01:11.159 mortgage
00:01:12.060 when you
00:01:14.220 are paying four percent
00:01:16.740 now I'm going to show you the difference
00:01:19.260 between a 12 line of credit
00:01:23.939 and a
00:01:25.340 7.35 percent mortgage interest loan
00:01:29.759 that they are giving you right now to
00:01:32.580 buy your home
00:01:34.200 so I'm going to do a comparison this is
00:01:36.240 a five hundred thousand dollar home
00:01:38.460 at 7.35 percent
00:01:41.280 now I'm doing this because I actually
00:01:43.560 have a client that just did this
00:01:46.619 a five hundred thousand dollar home at
00:01:49.700 7.35 percent
00:01:51.899 like I said I wanted to sit and cry with
00:01:54.720 him
00:01:55.799 but he wasn't even aware because we
00:01:58.380 haven't been told
00:01:59.700 we just don't know any better
00:02:01.860 but after this video is over you're
00:02:03.780 going to know better
00:02:05.340 you're going to know why
00:02:07.680 when I say a line of credit at 12
00:02:10.080 percent
00:02:11.760 is much healthier for your finances than
00:02:14.640 this baby 7.35 percent that they tricked
00:02:17.879 you into
00:02:18.900 so let's talk about it if you have a ten
00:02:22.020 thousand dollar line of credit
00:02:24.420 and you decide hey I want to put this
00:02:28.440 down on the principal of my home how
00:02:31.560 much interest would that save me if I
00:02:34.080 put ten thousand dollars on the
00:02:36.120 principal of my home so we take the ten
00:02:38.400 thousand dollars we put it on the five
00:02:41.040 hundred thousand dollar home and let's
00:02:42.959 just say that our payments begin July
00:02:45.360 the 1st of 2023 okay so you take the ten
00:02:49.500 thousand you've put it into the home and
00:02:51.900 you're at four hundred and ninety
00:02:53.459 thousand dollars now now remember you're
00:02:56.160 still making your mortgage payments
00:02:57.840 without taxes and insurance the mortgage
00:03:01.080 payment on this loan is three thousand
00:03:04.739 four hundred forty one dollars and forty
00:03:07.260 six cents a month it's just a baby
00:03:08.700 payment but you've got this huge home
00:03:11.280 right
00:03:12.780 so you brought the ten thousand now your
00:03:15.239 home balance is at four hundred and
00:03:16.980 ninety thousand what if you just decided
00:03:19.200 to go ahead and make the payments on
00:03:20.879 that mortgage and just see how long that
00:03:22.980 took you to get to 490 000. well if you
00:03:26.940 paid your payments
00:03:28.440 for 23 months to June 1st 2025 you are
00:03:34.680 going to be at four hundred and ninety
00:03:37.319 thousand dollar balance approximately
00:03:40.140 so it took you 23 months to get there
00:03:42.599 making
00:03:44.480 3441 in payments every month right but
00:03:48.060 how much interest did you pay to pay
00:03:50.040 that 23 months so if you take the 10 000
00:03:53.280 and you put it directly on the 500 000
00:03:55.680 home when is it four hundred and ninety
00:03:58.319 thousand dollars
00:04:00.239 today
00:04:03.120 July the 1st 2023
00:04:06.720 win your first mortgage payment is due
00:04:09.000 you took the ten thousand you put it on
00:04:11.879 your loan you're now at four hundred and
00:04:14.159 ninety thousand dollars and it didn't
00:04:15.659 take you 23 months to do it
00:04:18.418 but how much interest did you pay on
00:04:21.478 this
00:04:22.860 I mean this is a 12 line of credit right
00:04:27.120 let's see
00:04:28.800 so ten thousand
00:04:34.259 times twelve percent
00:04:38.820 equals what
00:04:40.919 twelve hundred dollars right
00:04:43.620 now remember that's a year
00:04:47.220 this is simple interest so ten thousand
00:04:50.400 times twelve percent is twelve hundred
00:04:52.380 dollars a year
00:04:54.360 now what if you said well I'm not even
00:04:57.300 going to pay on this I'm just going to
00:04:58.919 leave that sitting at 10 000.
00:05:01.740 I'll just pay the interest every month
00:05:03.600 and yeah it's like a hundred dollars a
00:05:05.699 month right so if you divide
00:05:08.040 1200
00:05:10.020 by 12 months you're going to get a
00:05:13.139 hundred dollars
00:05:15.900 yeah I don't even care I'll just I'll
00:05:17.940 just leave it sitting there
00:05:19.680 or you could take your income of ten
00:05:22.500 thousand dollars this person makes ten
00:05:24.419 thousand dollars in income has eight
00:05:26.520 thousand dollars in expenses he could
00:05:28.919 say you know what I'm just going to use
00:05:30.419 this line of credit as my checking
00:05:32.340 account and I'm gonna put my ten
00:05:35.699 thousand dollars in here
00:05:39.000 well what did that do to your balance as
00:05:41.340 soon as you put in your income
00:05:45.600 exactly
00:05:48.600 what is the payment on this line of
00:05:51.000 credit
00:05:53.639 exactly
00:05:55.740 when you put in your income into a line
00:05:57.720 of credit you have just satisfied that
00:05:59.639 payment and how much interest is on this
00:06:02.520 loan now that he has put in his ten
00:06:04.560 thousand dollars
00:06:06.660 zero
00:06:08.759 right
00:06:10.199 so yes his expenses could come out of
00:06:12.479 that now he could pay his expenses which
00:06:14.580 is eight thousand dollars a month
00:06:16.680 use this account as his checking account
00:06:18.900 his income goes in his expenses come out
00:06:21.300 he has put ten thousand dollars on his
00:06:23.639 mortgage and it did not cost him another
00:06:26.400 payment to do so
00:06:28.860 now let's talk about what happened over
00:06:31.020 here with the 23 months that you paid on
00:06:33.539 the mortgage
00:06:35.580 remember it took you 23 months just to
00:06:38.580 get to 490 000. here you got there in
00:06:41.460 one day
00:06:43.199 and if you decided not to pay it you've
00:06:45.660 paid twelve hundred dollars a year right
00:06:47.340 in interest
00:06:49.560 if you let this run through June of 2025
00:06:52.819 you are going to pay sixty nine thousand
00:06:55.860 at two hundred and thirty dollars in
00:06:58.259 interest alone
00:07:00.960 think about that
00:07:03.600 23 months of these three thousand four
00:07:06.840 hundred forty one dollar payments
00:07:09.000 three thousand of that is going to buy
00:07:12.360 the bank a house it is not going to pay
00:07:15.960 for your home
00:07:17.280 your little four hundred dollars here
00:07:20.400 that's all that's going into your home
00:07:23.639 twenty nine thousand two hundred and
00:07:25.800 thirty dollars oh you paid 79 000 Plus
00:07:29.240 in payments for 23 months but 69 of that
00:07:34.500 plus went to the bank not to your home
00:07:37.800 do you know that if you let this loan
00:07:40.139 run out for 30 years
00:07:42.060 that you're going to pay one million two
00:07:44.460 hundred thirty eight thousand nine
00:07:46.380 hundred and twenty four dollars in
00:07:47.880 payments do you know that you're going
00:07:50.280 to pay 738
00:07:53.060 924 dollars in interest alone
00:07:57.599 how many homes did you just buy the bank
00:08:00.139 exactly you paid for the bank's home
00:08:02.580 first you paid for the bank a home and
00:08:06.060 almost a half
00:08:08.580 just to get your five hundred thousand
00:08:11.220 dollar home
00:08:13.259 over here
00:08:15.539 you saved yourself 23 months you
00:08:17.819 actually cut 23 months off of this
00:08:20.039 mortgage
00:08:21.300 you actually saved yourself sixty nine
00:08:24.360 thousand two hundred and thirty dollars
00:08:26.879 in interest
00:08:28.620 in 23 months all in doing one ten
00:08:33.539 thousand dollar chunk
00:08:35.099 if you don't believe me pull up a Carl's
00:08:37.320 mortgage calculator or any mortgage
00:08:39.179 calculator put in the numbers 500 000 at
00:08:42.599 7.35 percent and see if I'm wrong
00:08:46.860 no payments here
00:08:50.100 baby interest if you do velocity banking
00:08:52.920 right you'll pay very very little
00:08:54.360 interest at making ten thousand dollars
00:08:56.339 a month
00:08:59.100 and let me tell you what's even worse on
00:09:01.800 top of this 69
00:09:03.720 000 for 23 months is when you get to
00:09:06.660 about 48 months
00:09:08.519 if that far you're gonna start getting
00:09:10.620 letters from your bank that holds your
00:09:12.899 mortgage and they're going to say hey
00:09:15.480 you've done real good on making your
00:09:17.100 payments for 48 months we want to give
00:09:20.040 you twenty five thousand dollars of
00:09:21.779 equity in your home why don't you
00:09:24.240 refinance and if you refinance we'll
00:09:27.720 even take a percent we'll knock you down
00:09:30.120 to six percent
00:09:31.680 we're gonna do you a favor
00:09:35.700 do you know what they just did if you
00:09:37.440 refinance
00:09:40.019 you are paying this all over again
00:09:44.760 it's a trick
00:09:47.339 you already bought them a home in the
00:09:49.620 first four years this is just 23 months
00:09:53.040 23 months of interest that could be in
00:09:57.360 your pocket
00:09:58.500 this hard-earned money for you need to
00:10:01.080 support your family you just supported
00:10:03.300 the bank and their family
00:10:05.760 this could have been in your pocket
00:10:08.880 and they'll do it to you again if you
00:10:11.700 refinance that home
00:10:13.560 so you have to make a decision am I
00:10:16.019 going to adult up and decide hey wait a
00:10:19.440 minute what
00:10:20.940 there's no excuses after seeing this
00:10:23.100 video
00:10:24.360 I don't even care if you got a 2.35
00:10:27.240 percent mortgage you are still getting
00:10:30.000 hit with interest that you do not
00:10:32.220 deserve
00:10:33.420 this little trick right here I've taken
00:10:35.820 at a 12 percent
00:10:38.580 oh they'll tell you all day long I can't
00:10:41.100 tell you how many clients in a week I
00:10:43.980 talk to that tell me they went into the
00:10:46.920 bank to get a line of credit
00:10:49.440 and the line of credits are usually like
00:10:51.540 nine percent
00:10:53.519 right now in the high nine percent
00:10:57.420 and then when they asked for a line they
00:11:00.000 will try to throw them in a loan every
00:11:03.240 single time
00:11:04.920 and what do they say
00:11:06.899 you don't want no nine percent line we
00:11:10.079 can give you this loan over here for
00:11:12.060 five percent
00:11:14.519 right
00:11:15.959 because that's amortized too
00:11:19.079 just like the mortgage all of that
00:11:21.720 interest is front loaded
00:11:24.000 to hit you so that you have to pay the
00:11:27.120 bank first
00:11:28.579 then as it trickles down you get to add
00:11:32.279 a little bit more to pay for your
00:11:34.079 motorcycle your car your home
00:11:36.779 with a mortgage when you get to the
00:11:39.000 15-year Mark now if you're in a 30-year
00:11:40.980 and you get by the refi and you don't do
00:11:43.440 it
00:11:44.399 and you keep
00:11:45.720 struggling on through
00:11:48.600 in year 15 you're going to start
00:11:51.300 breaking even with your payments
00:11:53.820 so if you're paying a three thousand
00:11:55.440 dollar payment on a mortgage in 15 years
00:11:57.720 about 1500 of that is now going to your
00:12:01.019 home and 1500 of that is still going to
00:12:03.600 the bank
00:12:05.459 I get angered when I hear that our young
00:12:08.519 people in America are getting long to
00:12:11.160 seven percent mortgages right now
00:12:15.779 seven percent
00:12:17.519 literally highway robbery
00:12:20.040 it's been going on since 1929.
00:12:23.519 and now you know how to fix the problem
00:12:26.160 you have to go get you a line of credit
00:12:27.899 I don't care if it's at 18 you're going
00:12:30.899 to beat this because 7 times 2 is 14 add
00:12:35.040 a 0 to that 140 percent this one's
00:12:38.519 paying over 140 percent because they're
00:12:40.680 at 7.35 that's a lot of money just to
00:12:44.220 throw out the window throw it over here
00:12:46.260 to me if you're just wanting to give
00:12:47.579 away money I'll take it guys we need to
00:12:50.459 get smarter than the paper that that
00:12:53.279 dollar bill is printed on because it is
00:12:55.980 worth nothing
00:12:57.959 okay
00:13:01.019 we have young American families that are
00:13:04.019 going into this debt not knowing there's
00:13:07.320 a better way
00:13:10.139 and I want to spread the word to anybody
00:13:12.540 and everybody that will listen please
00:13:15.120 know what you're doing when you buy a
00:13:17.040 mortgage please just have a line of
00:13:19.079 credit ready for you to take control of
00:13:21.779 your debt because it's going to control
