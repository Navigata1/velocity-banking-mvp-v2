00:00:01.000 the house that we're looking into
00:00:02.240 although it might be less interest rate
00:00:03.480 and less house at $400,000 you're still
00:00:05.560 looking at almost $500,000 at the
00:00:08.160 current interest rates and interest and
00:00:09.480 I was thinking well that' be cool if I
00:00:11.440 can also utilize this line line of
00:00:13.080 credit to hammer that out faster and get
00:00:16.560 a house paid off in 10 years maybe so
00:00:18.920 there's just multiple things that very
00:00:20.439 enticing about your videos so that's why
00:00:22.400 I'm here just to get your your your
00:00:24.480 intake and your input because the other
00:00:26.279 model I've been using is very stressful
00:00:27.920 and it's it's it's uh just not not
00:00:31.439 working right so all of that being said
00:00:35.320 do you realize that you could have your
00:00:38.920 cars and your home that you're currently
00:00:41.120 in paid off in 50 months no okay you are
00:00:46.199 in all wrong tools okay so you're using
00:00:49.680 the bank tools um they sell you as loans
00:00:52.879 if you were in a lines you wouldn't be
00:00:55.079 paying the ridiculous interest that you
00:00:56.760 are right now in your home that's just
00:00:59.160 literally what it comes down to and with
00:01:00.960 your cash flow uh you're looking
00:01:04.479 at the the most you're going to be in
00:01:07.400 debt is 49.7 five months so let's
00:01:11.759 pretend that you have $10,000 cash flow
00:01:15.680 and we know according to your worksheet
00:01:17.479 you have a little more than that now
00:01:20.000 that includes after you've made your
00:01:22.960 debt payments and paid all of your
00:01:24.680 living expenses okay so you're living
00:01:28.680 well with in the model which would be
00:01:32.560 you know for your home not to exceed 30%
00:01:36.040 of your bring home pay and your total
00:01:40.119 living expenses which are fixed costs
00:01:42.479 that you're paying every single month
00:01:44.360 that's not exceeding 50% so you're doing
00:01:47.200 really really good with your
00:01:49.399 money um where you're missing it is with
00:01:52.759 these loans because you're paying the
00:01:55.840 interest right
00:01:57.320 now that's what the lines of credit stop
00:02:00.320 you from doing is where they have front
00:02:03.320 loaded this ridiculous interest that
00:02:06.119 you've got at about 140% according to
00:02:09.639 your worksheet on that home so you are
00:02:13.560 absolutely right when you say that
00:02:16.640 you're going to be paying
00:02:18.640 $500,000 in interest on this home uh no
00:02:22.720 you're going to be paying closer to
00:02:26.160 $700,000 in interest on this home when
00:02:28.959 did you get the home
00:02:30.879 uh we got we got into the home in around
00:02:35.000 September what September last year we
00:02:36.879 got in the home so September 30 2022
00:02:39.480 yeah last year we missed out on two rate
00:02:41.760 locks that were lower because the the
00:02:43.480 house took so long to build so okay so
00:02:46.319 there are first lean hel loocks that you
00:02:48.800 can get so if you guys are planning on
00:02:51.800 moving get ready for the helck the helck
00:02:55.440 is like
00:02:56.760 $1,895 for origination fees and I'm sure
00:03:00.879 not looking at your documents at a
00:03:03.560 $566,000 balance you paid at least
00:03:06.840 $20,000 in origination fees yeah
00:03:09.840 probably your credit scores are good
00:03:11.959 enough and you've got the income to do
00:03:14.879 it so for goodness sake when you go for
00:03:17.400 your next appointment on buying a home
00:03:21.480 look at the vereline another thing is is
00:03:24.879 the interest on the home that you're
00:03:27.000 paying now tells me that 20
00:03:30.720 $950 is going towards interest out of
00:03:33.840 your payment so you have about
00:03:37.120 $538 it's actually hitting your home
00:03:42.120 okay where the lines of credit come into
00:03:45.599 play let's say if you decided okay I'm
00:03:48.280 going to start doing this today without
00:03:50.400 moving the home into a first lean HELOC
00:03:53.840 when you take a
00:03:55.920 $10,000 chunk $20,000 chunk off of a
00:03:59.799 line and put it into your mortgage this
00:04:03.159 principal balance that means that you're
00:04:07.760 saving uh if you were to do that
00:04:10.640 today you would be saving yourself even
00:04:14.760 if you guys are moving out soon okay
00:04:18.478 we're not talking about longterm get it
00:04:21.440 paid off we're talking about when you do
00:04:23.840 sell it what amount are you going to
00:04:26.680 have available to you because you're
00:04:28.720 saying that it's a $680,000 value
00:04:31.960 currently MH whatever you can pay on
00:04:34.919 that principle before you sell it that
00:04:37.120 is gravy for you okay right now you have
00:04:40.479 no gravy because you're only applying
00:04:42.639 about $500 a month to your actual amount
00:04:45.639 that you owe on the home so if you were
00:04:48.919 to do a $10,000 chump and you were to
00:04:52.720 throw $10,000 onto your
00:04:55.600 home that would jump you to August of 20
00:05:00.600 25 as far as your mortgage on the
00:05:04.440 amortisation schedule and that would
00:05:07.280 save
00:05:08.720 you
00:05:10.400 $54,000 in interest so that's just one
00:05:13.880 $110,000 chunk uh in your situation with
00:05:18.160 the money that you currently are making
00:05:21.440 you could not only do a $10,000 chunk
00:05:24.840 but let's say with your cash flow that
00:05:27.120 we just talked about you could do a
00:05:30.560 $100,000 chunk every 10 months and not
00:05:33.479 fill it because you would be rolling all
00:05:36.280 of that into a line of credit you know
00:05:39.600 exactly what that's going to save you
00:05:41.240 when it comes to interest if you were
00:05:43.120 able to do a $100,000 chunk let's say
00:05:45.600 you did a $20,000 chunk that's what I'm
00:05:48.400 saying is you have so much to gain by
00:05:51.319 getting a line of credit um $100,000
00:05:55.319 Chunk on your home today would save you
00:05:57.680 10 years 10 10
00:06:00.400 years plus
00:06:04.000 $280,000 plus on interest so when you're
00:06:07.720 thinking outside of the box and taking
00:06:09.759 your mind away from loans moving it into
00:06:13.000 lines you're going to save your wealth
00:06:16.919 money that you want to put into your
00:06:18.759 retirement can now go into that instead
00:06:21.360 of into these ridiculous loans so like I
00:06:24.199 said earlier if you get into a right
00:06:26.880 tool today you're going to have all of
00:06:29.560 your debt including your home your cars
00:06:33.000 everything paid off within 50 months
00:06:35.520 that's just math it's just that you're
00:06:38.759 doing nothing but paying interest right
00:06:40.599 now right okay so you have you have
00:06:44.599 several ways to move here you could go
00:06:47.080 get a basic line of credit because you
00:06:49.080 were talking about feeling threatened
00:06:50.919 like it seemed a little dangerous to you
00:06:53.520 know put so much money into your your
00:06:56.639 Equity or whatever you're talking about
00:06:59.120 um you're already into your Equity
00:07:01.400 566,000 mhm so getting a $100,000 line
00:07:06.800 of credit is going to chunk onto the
00:07:10.120 homes principal and now you still are in
00:07:13.199 566,000 but the thing is is when you
00:07:16.879 have a line on the side of your
00:07:19.440 mortgage with your like I said with your
00:07:22.599 income and your cash flow that Line's
00:07:25.160 going to be gone in8 to 10 months then
00:07:27.759 you're going to pick it up and do it
00:07:29.080 again
00:07:29.879 that's how fast your house is going to
00:07:31.520 pay off so imagine $100,000 that you're
00:07:34.280 paying off every eight to 10 months how
00:07:36.960 fast your mortgage is going to be gone
00:07:39.599 yeah exactly so especially if we move
00:07:41.560 into a house that's less around we're
00:07:43.360 only going to finance I guess or this
00:07:45.360 first line HELOC it'll be about after 6%
00:07:48.639 total with closing costs commission I'm
00:07:51.479 assuming the house is going to be about
00:07:53.360 4 415,000 410,000 so you're
00:07:56.840 saying um that sounds like said 6% what
00:08:01.039 where did you go with that so this house
00:08:03.599 is at you know we have 566 at like six
00:08:06.080 point I think I put 6.25 or
00:08:08.159 6.75% the next house that we're
00:08:10.120 hopefully getting in by this fall is the
00:08:12.639 purchase price the total purchase price
00:08:14.199 will be about 415,000 and we're going to
00:08:16.360 roll over our everything we get from
00:08:19.240 this house we're going to roll over
00:08:21.080 everything into that next one so that
00:08:23.599 our mortgage will only be probably it
00:08:27.000 will be sub
00:08:28.240 400,000 unless we do this first line
00:08:30.720 HELOC which I'm still kind of confused
00:08:32.039 about so really it won't be 4.5 years or
00:08:35.200 4850 months it'll be less than that
00:08:36.919 because we'll be starting we'll be
00:08:38.399 starting at a baseline value of about
00:08:40.039 390,000 instead of 566 okay so that's
00:08:44.440 the the kind of purpose of this is
00:08:46.000 definitely that like I like to hear that
00:08:47.680 it'll only take 50 months in our current
00:08:49.480 situation if we didn't leave this house
00:08:51.320 but we want to leave this house to be
00:08:53.600 even catapulted forward even faster so
00:08:57.240 new new numbers would be around 410,000
00:08:59.160 ,000 starting mortgage with hopefully a
00:09:01.640 lower interest rate but at this point it
00:09:03.760 doesn't seem like it really matters if
00:09:05.160 we're doing 100 grand every 10 months it
00:09:07.800 sounds like the house would be paid off
00:09:09.200 in like three years or three and a half
00:09:11.800 years or something if you if you did
00:09:13.640 nothing but just said okay I'm going to
00:09:15.320 use a line of credit uh for the next
00:09:19.519 purchase that you make um and you had a
00:09:22.680 $390,000 balance and then you added in
00:09:25.640 8,500 for your vehicles uh you're you're
00:09:29.640 still going to be at a three-year payoff
00:09:31.680 for everything a three-year payoff well
00:09:33.920 that's that's crazy okay it is crazy but
00:09:36.200 you make good money and you have good
00:09:38.160 cash flow and you're learning how to use
00:09:40.680 lines of
00:09:42.000 credit so how long did you think you're
00:09:44.160 going to be in your
00:09:45.880 mortgage I was hoping you know we were
00:09:48.040 talking about if we just did an extra
00:09:49.519 thousand a month it would be you know 21
00:09:52.040 point something years or 18 years I
00:09:53.600 can't remember the math I just did a few
00:09:54.839 weeks back but that was like all best
00:09:56.680 case scenario and I was still looking at
00:09:58.079 the am Edition schedule still saying
00:09:59.760 well you know instead of5 or $600,000 in
00:10:03.240 interest at least it's 250 or 300 you
00:10:05.360 know um obviously this sounds much more
00:10:08.040 appealing but I just didn't know can we
00:10:10.200 qualify for $100,000 on a credit um we
00:10:12.880 don't know you know we were talking how
00:10:14.160 does that work when we need expenses
00:10:15.560 like we don't understand how this how
00:10:17.160 you just pull things out of a line of
00:10:18.720 credit like is it like a card is it like
00:10:20.399 a like a connected to your bank account
00:10:22.480 we just don't understand anything about
00:10:24.279 that um that's the scary part is it's
00:10:26.760 the unknown of how to utilize a line of
00:10:28.480 credit to make this work well you know
00:10:32.399 what just like I'm scared to death of
00:10:34.800 flying and you're not because you know
00:10:36.920 how every bit of those instruments work
00:10:39.399 right um if you teach me that and make
00:10:41.959 me feel safe in a plane I'll teach you
00:10:43.760 this perfect I mean it's I'm an
00:10:46.200 instructor so I can teach you I I still
00:10:48.320 fly small planes so it is just a it's
00:10:52.320 just what you know and I mean just like
00:10:54.519 you understand that airplane and how
00:10:57.040 that works once you learn how a line
00:10:59.839 works it's not going to be scary anymore
00:11:01.839 because it's so simple I mean I say that
00:11:04.079 in my videos and people are like it's
00:11:05.680 not simple but it is it's so simple it's
00:11:08.519 just a tool so just like I you know just
00:11:13.120 like your tools on that plane you use
00:11:16.000 different ones to do different things
00:11:18.120 right once you learn how the tool in the
00:11:20.519 bank works it's just as simple so just
00:11:24.399 like you're making payments right now
00:11:26.480 monthly because that's simple to you
00:11:28.279 because that's what they T you to do but
00:11:30.440 once you have 390,000
00:11:34.360 and this is a Helo a home equity line of
00:11:38.680 credit the only difference between this
00:11:42.120 line and a mortgage is the interest
00:11:47.279 okay the mortgage is pushed because the
00:11:51.279 interest is so lucrative to them they I
00:11:56.079 don't know if you've seen the videos
00:11:57.760 where I talk about the difference
00:11:59.720 between the mortgage and the HELOC but
00:12:02.519 to kind of educate you a minute the
00:12:05.920 HELOC is a simple interest product
00:12:08.880 meaning that right now the rate is
00:12:12.839 7.25% but it's
00:12:15.040 simple okay a loan is an amortised
00:12:20.440 schedule so that means that you have
00:12:23.839 your set payment and let's say it's
00:12:25.760 3,000 a month it is set every month your
00:12:29.000 going to make a $3,000 payment but what
00:12:32.720 they didn't tell you when you signed the
00:12:34.680 contract on the home you have now is
00:12:37.760 that this interest throughout this 30
00:12:41.800 years is pushed to the front of the loan
00:12:46.760 so they take the interest and figure it
00:12:51.000 for 30 years but where they get us is
00:12:54.480 they push it in the first seven years so
00:12:58.079 that's why you're spinning your wheels
00:13:00.160 in the first seven to 10 to 15 years is
00:13:02.959 because you're paying the bank first
00:13:05.279 you're buying their house first then you
00:13:08.440 get to buy your home so the first 15
00:13:11.560 years of a mortgage is 15 years you're
00:13:14.800 still paying half but the majority hit
00:13:17.320 in the first seven why do they do that
00:13:20.600 well it's statistically proven that
00:13:23.880 every American family is either one
00:13:26.800 going to move within the first seven
00:13:29.240 years which is what you're getting ready
00:13:31.040 to do right or they're going to
00:13:33.720 refinance by the fourth year so they win
00:13:37.760 you move just like you're doing right
00:13:39.560 now you're paying them to rent you're
00:13:42.000 not gaining anything off of what you're
00:13:43.880 giving them right now when you move as
00:13:47.279 they know you're going to you're going
00:13:48.959 to do it again you're going to move into
00:13:50.959 another mortgage and you're going to
00:13:52.279 spend your wheels again until you and
00:13:54.000 your wife decide to either move again or
00:13:56.920 uh let's just refinance because we're
00:13:58.279 going to get a lower rate is that not
00:14:00.120 what you just said to
00:14:01.680 me so we sat around with those
00:14:04.680 conceptions in our mind because that's
00:14:06.440 what they told us to think is that we're
00:14:08.680 going to move anyway or we're going to
00:14:11.360 go ahead and refinance to a lower rate
00:14:13.639 which does nothing but reset all of that
00:14:16.120 interest you just paid okay so they're
00:14:19.800 making a killing this is how the banks
00:14:22.279 are so huge when you're moving into the
00:14:25.440 7.25 that's a simple interest this
00:14:29.079 interest is literally only charged over
00:14:33.040 what you did in 30 days not 30 years so
00:14:38.199 with your income being so large so with
00:14:41.600 a
00:14:43.000 $390,000 line now that's
00:14:46.399 revolving so this is revolving this
00:14:49.000 means you're going to have a checking
00:14:50.639 account with this line and it's going to
00:14:53.399 be your checking account now so they're
00:14:55.720 going to give you 390,000 as a a balance
00:14:59.279 on your home that when you put in your
00:15:03.040 $20,000 income every month is going to
00:15:06.040 smack this
00:15:07.800 down well when it comes down your your
00:15:12.160 interest is charged off of the average
00:15:15.160 so what was your average throughout the
00:15:17.839 month not what is the high balance not
00:15:20.800 on this okay so that's how you win when
00:15:24.519 we're using all of our income that goes
00:15:26.880 in and hits this line first first then
00:15:30.480 we pull out all the expenses the other
00:15:33.959 uh living expenses debt whatever we've
00:15:36.079 got to pay on so now you're back up to a
00:15:40.639 380 on the home you're paying for now
00:15:43.720 you're not going to be $10,000 down on
00:15:46.639 that home until about
00:15:50.000 2026 you did it in one payment of
00:15:53.800 putting your income in that's the
00:15:56.839 difference is you're knocking this
00:15:58.800 balance down every month and you're not
00:16:01.440 doing anything different you didn't get
00:16:03.319 an extra job you're using a different
00:16:05.399 tool that the bank already
00:16:07.480 offers so that's how your home's going
00:16:09.759 to pay off so fast is you're using your
00:16:12.759 income and you're revolving it every
00:16:14.880 month through this account that's just
00:16:16.519 bringing this balance down until it pays
00:16:18.959 off now another thing that's a real Plus
00:16:22.000 on these lines let's say that you get
00:16:24.880 into a line the 390,000 you've been in
00:16:28.959 it for
00:16:31.519 um okay so you're going to okay so let's
00:16:35.240 say that the the value of the home that
00:16:37.880 you're buying is 500,000 M at your
00:16:41.800 credit score they're going to give you
00:16:46.519 $450,000 you're going to have
00:16:49.920 $390,000 of
00:16:52.240 that in home so that's going to leave
00:16:55.360 you with
00:16:56.440 $60,000 by the time they pay off the
00:16:59.600 mortgage or the the home you paid the
00:17:01.800 people that you're buying it from you're
00:17:03.680 going to have $60,000 left over to pay
00:17:07.160 off your cars or whatever okay so let's
00:17:10.319 say that you use the whole
00:17:13.480 450,000 because youve paid off debt and
00:17:16.199 now you owe
00:17:17.919 450,000 it's the same thing the $20,000
00:17:21.919 will go in to this line but those car
00:17:27.160 payments that you had before are gone so
00:17:29.880 now you're just putting all of the cash
00:17:32.200 flow into here that's why you have say a
00:17:35.919 $110,000 cash flow today when you pay
00:17:38.840 off the car loans you're going to have
00:17:40.880 1,200 right because they're like yeah
00:17:43.880 18,800 more dollars that's just coming
00:17:46.960 in here and sitting so now your expenses
00:17:49.799 may be $8,000 a month so you're at
00:17:53.760 438,000 by the end of your first month
00:17:57.240 see how fast you went for from 450 to
00:17:59.679 438 in one month right because it's a
00:18:02.480 simple it's a simple interest not a not
00:18:04.919 front loaded for the first seven years
00:18:06.799 of crazy interest rates because I do
00:18:08.360 look at that on our payment I see you
00:18:10.039 know $3,100 $3,200 interest like 900
00:18:13.360 bucks in principal and then you know
00:18:15.080 we've got um you know taxes fees
00:18:17.280 whatever and it's like I I know it's
00:18:19.000 frustrating but I don't know how this is
00:18:20.880 what's good for us to hear is we we want
00:18:22.720 another method to to get rid of this
00:18:24.640 because like I said when we open up a
00:18:25.760 small business we want to have as little
00:18:27.240 overhead as possible but want to have
00:18:28.799 access to cash if we need it and then
00:18:31.200 being able to have access to Quick Cash
00:18:32.720 and being comfortable with dumping all
00:18:34.240 of our income literally every month as
00:18:36.600 long as we have that's what our big
00:18:38.080 question was was how do we access this
00:18:39.919 quickly you said it's tied to a bank
00:18:41.480 account yes this is a checking account
00:18:44.760 so what happens is it's a side by side
00:18:48.080 so when you have like mine for example I
00:18:52.559 have my
00:18:54.080 helck and my checking so I keep the
00:18:57.760 checking at a a zero balance which is
00:19:00.000 what they do on the first lean it's a
00:19:02.880 zero balance so if I have say my
00:19:05.039 electric bill comes in and it's
00:19:07.320 $400 it hits the zero and on these first
00:19:11.760 lean it'll sit here until midnight and
00:19:15.000 it's a sweep account so at midnight it
00:19:17.720 will come out of the HELOC pay off the
00:19:19.960 400 and now the 400 will be in the
00:19:23.200 HELOC okay now let's say you get paid
00:19:26.320 tomorrow uh you have a,
00:19:28.840 that comes in from your paycheck at 12
00:19:31.520 midnight it'll sweep into this helck and
00:19:34.840 now you've got $1,000 less owed on the
00:19:38.400 HELOC and this is automated
00:19:41.440 automated it can it be with our current
00:19:43.559 existing bank account no they set up one
00:19:47.039 on now if you get a HELOC with your
00:19:49.640 current bank and they'll link the
00:19:51.760 accounts then it can serve as the same
00:19:53.840 thing if you're running a schedule on
00:19:56.400 that and you did a $20,000
00:20:00.360 chunk what would happen is your
00:20:04.039 380 would be knocked down to
00:20:08.159 360 and that's going to knock
00:20:12.080 off to May of
00:20:17.600 2027 so it'll jump the schedule to May
00:20:21.360 of
00:20:22.880 2027 and it's going to save
00:20:26.360 you closer to 6 ,000 in interest so this
00:20:31.440 $120,000 chunk onto your
00:20:34.720 $390,000 loan at
00:20:37.440 5% is still going to you're going to
00:20:40.360 wipe it out really fast because as soon
00:20:42.919 as you put this
00:20:44.640 2,000 from any line into this your
00:20:49.520 income is going to go right back in and
00:20:51.640 you're going to be back down to a zero
00:20:53.320 balance MH so your first month is going
00:20:57.559 to be taking care of your expenses then
00:21:00.000 are going to come back out so this house
00:21:02.039 payment 239 a month so with your house
00:21:07.840 payment and everything coming back out
00:21:09.600 in expenses let's say it's
00:21:12.000 10,000 you could immediately in your
00:21:14.520 second month do another $10,000 chunk so
00:21:18.559 you're already down so you at 360 then
00:21:21.919 you'd be at 350 right when your when
00:21:25.400 your income goes in again you're going
00:21:28.600 to do it again so you're talking about
00:21:31.760 you literally could do $10,000 chunks
00:21:35.440 through the line into this every month
00:21:38.400 so how long is it going to take you to
00:21:39.840 have your home paid
00:21:42.360 off how was that 10 so that's 120 a year
00:21:45.600 so 380 like three and a half years maybe
00:21:49.000 if I'm really if we're really really
00:21:50.320 pushing it probably three and a half
00:21:52.200 years yeah three four years so you're
00:21:55.080 still going to get your cars and your
00:21:57.640 home paid off in about 48 months and
00:22:00.640 with your credit score and income it
00:22:02.320 ought to be very easy to get
00:22:04.720 either okay um so what what limit should
00:22:08.760 we be looking for to make this all
00:22:11.320 happen as quick just a $20,000 Line
00:22:13.120 Credit is that that's fine I mean you
00:22:14.760 can use that I think that I I would
00:22:17.240 definitely try to get more uh because
00:22:19.880 the more you get the more damage you do
00:22:22.360 upfront on the mortgage like a 50,000
00:22:24.880 would be even better yeah so like let's
00:22:27.240 say because you could pay off 50,000
00:22:30.120 every five months easy okay just based
00:22:33.480 on what you're showing me right now
00:22:35.279 right so if you were to do a $50,000
00:22:38.279 Chunk on the 380,000
00:22:40.880 you have literally knocked off you've
00:22:44.000 knocked your schedule up to July of
00:22:48.440 2031 so that means that you've saved
00:22:53.120 that's like nine years of Interest saved
00:22:54.520 right there eight years of Interest
00:22:56.400 $117,600
00:22:58.159 in interest as well just one chunk that
00:23:02.679 you can have paid off in five
00:23:06.279 months okay well that's yeah that's kind
00:23:08.440 of depressing that this is not
00:23:10.919 more um you know widely known because
00:23:13.320 you know as kids growing up we look at
00:23:14.640 our parents and we watch them just pay
00:23:16.000 30-year mortgage and then they pay it
00:23:17.640 off you know after buying a house in
00:23:19.640 1980 Something retir They after
00:23:21.919 retirement they pay it off and they go
00:23:23.159 into the sunset like wow that's I guess
00:23:24.440 is how it works that you just wait 30
00:23:26.880 years and I'm just like this does not
00:23:29.240 sound appealing at all amortization
00:23:31.640 schedule a packet this big you pay $1.2
00:23:33.960 million for a $500,000 home I was like
00:23:36.799 this just doesn't sound uh fun it
00:23:39.880 doesn't sound right it doesn't sound fun
00:23:41.279 and I was like this there has to be a
00:23:42.400 better way so I just Google Google
00:23:43.760 Google and finally found you so um sad
00:23:48.000 it's sad is what it is and you know they
00:23:50.240 sell it as the American dream the
00:23:52.240 American dream is to own the
00:23:54.320 home and but where they got us and it
00:23:58.000 was started in
00:23:59.360 1929 um they literally named it what it
00:24:02.520 is uh mortgage and how they advertised
00:24:05.600 it as you can now own this big property
00:24:09.120 for this little bitty payment but what
00:24:11.600 they did was when they named it they
00:24:14.960 gave it exactly what it
00:24:17.520 is Mort is
00:24:21.520 Mor yeah mortal yeah death they named it
00:24:25.600 death Gage which is grip or uh you know
00:24:30.120 any any kind of contract you're going
00:24:32.840 into yeah so you're talking about a
00:24:35.000 death of grip or a death pledge however
00:24:38.520 you want to say it so they named it for
00:24:40.880 what it is because you're either going
00:24:42.520 to pay it on it till you die or you're
00:24:45.559 going to lose it because you're not
00:24:47.440 going to make the payments the reason
00:24:49.360 that the line and the loan are totally
00:24:53.200 two different animals you've got a line
00:24:55.080 that's a little baby kitty cat and then
00:24:57.080 you've got this the loans that are this
00:24:59.440 big ferocious lion and what makes it so
00:25:03.799 different is the way the interest is set
00:25:06.799 up the line is a simple interest the
00:25:10.080 loan is an advertise schedule so they
00:25:13.240 take the loan interest that's over 30
00:25:16.640 years and they frontload it in the first
00:25:19.720 seven years that's why all of your
00:25:21.559 payments right now are going to interest
00:25:23.640 except a little over 500 a month so when
00:25:27.840 they are setting you up in that first
00:25:30.720 seven years they statistically know
00:25:33.720 every American family is either going to
00:25:35.720 move in the first seven years which is
00:25:37.799 what you guys are getting ready to do or
00:25:40.640 you're going to refinance by the fourth
00:25:42.799 year which is going to reset the
00:25:45.399 interest anyway so they win it doesn't
00:25:48.080 matter if you're in it for um the move
00:25:51.440 or if you're buy they're going to get
00:25:53.919 the additional interest only 1% of
00:25:56.320 Americans ever pay off their mortgage so
00:25:59.120 everybody is throwing out all of this
00:26:01.480 interest that they think they're buy
00:26:03.159 one%
00:26:05.159 1% wow that's sad that is very sad and
00:26:08.760 just like your parents they work all of
00:26:10.679 their lives to pay the bank for
00:26:12.679 something they didn't even ever have to
00:26:14.960 pay for it was already theirs they just
00:26:17.399 didn't know how to use it I didn't learn
00:26:19.559 about this until I was 40 no I was
00:26:22.919 39 yeah well I mean we were doing the I
00:26:27.000 know it's not your favorite but the
00:26:28.440 whole Ramsay schedule for like two years
00:26:31.679 and I was like this is not it's like
00:26:34.159 every month you know we paid off our
00:26:35.279 student loans we paid off all our credit
00:26:37.080 cards we got yeah we paid off about a
00:26:39.080 100 Grand of student loans within like
00:26:40.880 two years and know less than that it was
00:26:42.880 like it was like seven it was like seven
00:26:44.240 months seven months and it was just
00:26:45.480 painful and I was like you know we have
00:26:46.559 no money at the end of every month we uh
00:26:48.320 we're dumping everything into cash flow
00:26:50.120 we don't have any flexibility to do
00:26:51.399 anything and I was like this beans and
00:26:53.399 rice sorry excuse my language I was
00:26:55.320 like it's not working and I was like I
00:26:57.840 don't and I and I don't believe in not
00:26:59.159 investing now like I'm like I we we just
00:27:02.039 got into our careers about four to five
00:27:03.600 years ago each and we're finally able to
00:27:06.120 to have a 401k we're finally able to
00:27:07.760 have a back door Roth we're finally able
00:27:09.080 to have a brokage account and I want to
00:27:10.720 keep this money in there to stack up
00:27:12.279 while I'm we're paying off of the things
00:27:13.720 is we realize we have a really really
00:27:15.559 really good income very fortunate to
00:27:16.960 have that works very hard to get where
00:27:18.480 we're at and we need to make sure we
00:27:20.559 catapult ourselves I want to be 20 years
00:27:22.799 ahead of of where I want to be you know
00:27:25.720 when I'm 45 50 right and doing this
00:27:28.600 whole other method it was just it's it's
00:27:31.159 too stressful it's too slow and I'm not
00:27:33.600 going to cancel all my 401ks and just
00:27:35.559 start dumping all this money into a
00:27:36.799 mortgage for nothing and then I get to
00:27:38.880 I'm 50 and my 41 case sitting there
00:27:40.760 still at 230,000 hers is still at 85 and
00:27:43.840 I'm like what what were we doing why
00:27:45.519 were we doing that you know because we
00:27:46.679 want compound interest we want it moving
00:27:48.360 and this sounds like the absolute best
00:27:49.880 way and I just wanted to get you on the
00:27:51.559 phone because I needed to hear it
00:27:53.399 oneon-one and not just you know hear a
00:27:56.039 YouTube video I want my wife to hear
00:27:57.279 this too because you know I'm the
00:27:59.159 YouTube study the finance thing like go
00:28:01.840 research and that's how I found you and
00:28:03.799 I just wanted to hear this um but you
00:28:05.519 know we need to take the step it sounds
00:28:07.039 like and just secure a land of credit
00:28:09.679 and like you said
00:28:11.080 50,000 um you know in five months
00:28:13.200 $17,000 in interest on the on the
00:28:15.240 potential the new home three and a half
00:28:16.679 four years paying off that sounds like
00:28:18.120 we win uh you know we lose we still lose
00:28:20.399 a little obviously because you know
00:28:21.679 we're doing things wrong here to get to
00:28:23.399 get to get going to get into another
00:28:24.799 house you know they willon that battle
00:28:26.279 but I want to ultimately WI the War I
00:28:27.840 know it's cliche but I feel like if we
00:28:29.600 get into this now yes we we lost money
00:28:32.760 obviously but hope we were young enough
00:28:34.880 to where we can recoup from that quickly
00:28:37.440 so and your parents are going to be so
00:28:40.360 so proud of you when they see that
00:28:41.960 you're a homeowner and less than you
00:28:43.559 know four years Max and you know it's uh
00:28:48.000 my grandmother she's the one I think of
00:28:50.279 because when you were talking about your
00:28:51.559 parents um she was a single mom U
00:28:56.000 because of a bad had marriage and you
00:28:58.880 know she was a school teacher so she the
00:29:02.200 only thing she got out of the marriage
00:29:03.840 was the home they had built and thank
00:29:06.679 goodness you know because that's what
00:29:08.200 she literally used to live on so she
00:29:10.440 would work uh pay down the home
00:29:13.679 refinance get out money to like buy the
00:29:16.320 kids cars or whatever you know work more
00:29:20.120 years refinance I don't know how many
00:29:23.000 times that woman refinanced but I
00:29:25.080 thought when I was of age okay we have a
00:29:28.440 home and we're never going to pay it off
00:29:31.039 so um I think about her and she was just
00:29:34.440 in the you know 1929 that's when she was
00:29:37.159 born so that's what she was raised in
00:29:39.679 was we just you know the home is our
00:29:42.279 asset that we just use and the thing is
00:29:45.039 is what's so stupid about it you can do
00:29:47.919 the exact same thing with a line but
00:29:50.640 you're not getting just toppled with all
00:29:53.399 of that interest you know you're you're
00:29:55.440 using a different simple interest is
00:29:57.720 line uh so that's why I'm screaming to
00:30:01.480 the world uh through these YouTube
00:30:03.760 videos because the more people that can
00:30:06.200 learn before they shut me down uh then
00:30:08.880 you'll know you know what you need to be
00:30:10.440 doing as far as with these lines of
00:30:12.360 credit and get out of these loans your
00:30:14.600 car loans are eating you up right now
00:30:16.640 yeah you have far less you know YouTube
00:30:18.320 views likes subscribers than a lot of
00:30:21.159 the bigger Financial gurus people aren't
00:30:24.559 interested in that type of um finances
00:30:27.320 device because it doesn't make as
00:30:28.559 produce as much interest for super rich
00:30:31.120 people and you know we're we want to be
00:30:32.840 rich one day we're not but um we are
00:30:35.480 being stifled it sounds like completely
00:30:37.279 by the system that we only knew from
00:30:39.600 children growing up into young adulthood
00:30:42.120 now and we're just trying to change
00:30:43.519 immediately this is channel has been up
00:30:45.559 for one year so I'm making waves and
00:30:51.799 that's kind of what's scary about you
00:30:53.640 know it getting shut down because I've
00:30:56.720 gained so much attention in one year
00:30:59.679 because people are getting awake you
00:31:01.960 know they're like what what do she say
00:31:04.440 and even though I have some naysayers
00:31:06.600 there is a bunch of people that are
00:31:09.559 falling in the line here and getting
00:31:11.440 their debt I get every day I get
00:31:14.279 messages hey I have paid off you know
00:31:17.000 this in the last three months I hear
00:31:19.159 that all the time so it's making waves
00:31:22.799 and I'm really if I wanted to be nervous
00:31:25.440 it would be about Dave Ramsey
00:31:28.080 because he is everywhere and he's
00:31:31.519 teaching a
00:31:33.519 1960s cash method and that would be
00:31:36.240 great if we were still in 1960 but we're
00:31:39.320 credit system now we're not a cash
00:31:41.279 system they're trying to take cash away
00:31:43.799 and he can sit and say all day long that
00:31:46.279 we're still that we're not everybody
00:31:48.559 needs credit you need credit to survive
00:31:52.519 right and so I'm moving it into a credit
00:31:56.039 system and you know the larger I get the
00:31:59.320 more attention is he's going to come I'm
00:32:01.919 just waiting on it so it makes me you
00:32:05.399 know makes me a little nervous because
00:32:07.320 I'm nowhere near as smart as he is in
00:32:09.919 what he does but it's still common sense
00:32:13.440 that he's teaching uh you know take your
00:32:16.320 last 50 bucks cash flow and throw it
00:32:18.399 into a loan that you're never going to
00:32:20.919 see again and I'm saying take your last
00:32:23.960 50 bucks a month and throw it into a
00:32:25.840 line so when you have that emergency
00:32:28.279 you're going to have access to your line
00:32:29.960 and you can pull it back out and use it
00:32:32.039 again that's and that's why we wanted to
00:32:34.679 seek advice too because um opening up a
00:32:37.360 business is another like dream of ours
00:32:39.480 that we've had for like years and years
00:32:41.360 and we want to have that um just extra
00:32:44.440 cash flow like you said without going in
00:32:46.159 a massive massive debt and just
00:32:48.120 basically paying ourselves back every
00:32:49.799 single and not being able to utilize it
00:32:51.200 because it sounds too easy that I put
00:32:54.039 money in and then I can immediately use
00:32:56.240 it again and then I put money in and I
00:32:58.240 can use it again and it's a simple
00:33:00.000 interest every month you know um in
00:33:02.799 large chunks it just you know like I can
00:33:05.200 I can take the money out to pay my
00:33:06.240 mortgage or I can take the money out to
00:33:07.480 pay a car but I couldn't do that with a
00:33:08.880 credit card I couldn't do that with
00:33:09.840 anything else because first off they
00:33:11.200 don't allow you to link it up to that
00:33:12.799 and you'd be paying crazy interest on
00:33:14.200 the card and the loan anyways for the
00:33:15.559 car and the house it was like what's you
00:33:18.679 know it just sounds like the thing is
00:33:20.559 here it's just it's not widely known
00:33:23.120 method and um because of you know it's
00:33:27.080 fine I like our democracy and a
00:33:28.320 capitalist Society but more stuff like
00:33:30.159 this needs to be known for people that
00:33:31.279 are trying to get out quicker so we're
00:33:33.120 not a slave to Big
00:33:35.240 Banks but see that's the the
00:33:38.080 misconception too is you know Donald
00:33:40.679 Trump is he is not using loans he's
00:33:43.760 using lines right I actually was
00:33:47.080 reminded this morning because I was
00:33:48.480 listening to this thing that the
00:33:50.639 banks um are using the infinite Banking
00:33:54.399 and we don't even know about that we're
00:33:56.279 putting in 401ks and we're putting into
00:33:58.679 all this other stuff at the stock market
00:34:00.760 that they don't even use themselves they
00:34:02.960 use infinite banking so you're just like
00:34:06.320 we're the rich are getting richer
00:34:09.199 because they're feeding us the working
00:34:11.440 class and the middle class and the
00:34:12.719 higher middle class they're feeding us
00:34:15.119 the
00:34:16.199 loans because that's how they're getting
00:34:18.239 richer now the one thing they're going
00:34:20.719 to say every time yeah is they're going
00:34:23.960 to say you don't want that you want this
00:34:26.000 loan because it's a lower interest rate
00:34:28.199 every I heard that in your video yeah
00:34:30.280 yeah so when you go in I mean don't be
00:34:33.119 rude about it but just when they say
00:34:34.960 that say um yeah but I really want a
00:34:38.000 revolving line of credit revolving line
00:34:40.199 of credit yeah I heard that in YouTube
00:34:41.520 is don't let them push you into a yeah
00:34:44.159 they're going to they're going to and
00:34:46.040 they might get rude there's a I have
00:34:48.040 people tell me all the time that you
00:34:49.599 know they said well why in the world
00:34:51.560 would you want to do something like that
00:34:53.320 you're just going to get yourself in a
00:34:54.560 mess so they don't know they're not
00:34:56.879 being rude on purpose they're just like
00:34:58.480 us they don't know and I'm talking one
00:35:00.920 of my clients and he has been the senior
00:35:04.000 mortgage loan officer for 40 years and
00:35:07.599 now he's using the INF method I asked
00:35:11.000 him I said why why are why are you
00:35:13.040 coming to me and he said I've never
00:35:14.680 heard of this before I said you have
00:35:16.800 been working in a bank all of your life
00:35:20.520 he said I just never had realized you
00:35:22.440 could use a line of credit like that
00:35:24.400 yeah that's pretty sad yeah well that's
00:35:27.240 why we're here and I'm just we're just
00:35:28.320 glad that we uh found it so yeah I'm
00:35:31.400 thankful I'm thankful I learned it too I
