00:00:04.319 and on this channel I teach velocity
00:00:06.120 banking today we are going to be
00:00:07.839 discussing how the banks are sucking the
00:00:10.840 life out of your finances and how you
00:00:14.080 can stop it you have a choice after you
00:00:16.920 see this video today you have a choice
00:00:20.800 you are choosing to throw your money out
00:00:23.279 the window if you continue doing what
00:00:25.599 I'm about to speak on in this video it's
00:00:28.599 your choice we need to wake up and we
00:00:31.199 need to take control of our money when
00:00:33.480 we are sitting back letting stuff like
00:00:35.600 this happen it's our fault if you are
00:00:39.440 broke if you are living paycheck to
00:00:41.960 paycheck maybe it's because you are in
00:00:44.640 this situation right here this is a real
00:00:47.160 life scenario I worked with a couple
00:00:49.320 today that is in this exact scenario I
00:00:52.800 want to share it with you because I want
00:00:54.640 you to see how angering it is that you
00:00:57.480 are not aware of the different tool
00:00:59.920 tools that's available at the bank to
00:01:02.199 help you come out of debt you instead
00:01:05.920 have been trained to make payments you
00:01:09.040 have been trained to believe mortgages
00:01:11.600 are your way to buying your home I want
00:01:14.320 to show you a different way I hope that
00:01:17.200 you have ears to hear and that you will
00:01:19.880 pay attention to how much money this
00:01:22.560 couple is throwing out the window if
00:01:25.720 they allow this to happen to them they
00:01:27.799 currently have an income of 52 $0000 a
00:01:30.640 month they have $4,100 in expenses
00:01:33.799 coming out every month this includes
00:01:35.520 their home this includes their food
00:01:37.920 their gas all their living expenses so
00:01:40.680 after all of their expenses come out
00:01:43.079 they are left with a cash flow of $1,100
00:01:46.079 per month now let's go over here they
00:01:48.320 have purchased a home the purchase price
00:01:50.560 was
00:01:52.159 $150,000 they put down
00:01:54.680 $155,000 which left them a balance of
00:01:58.439 $135,000 then of of course they got a
00:02:00.719 mortgage because that's what they tell
00:02:02.479 us to do you want a home get a mortgage
00:02:05.880 you can buy your home you can have
00:02:07.520 little bitty baby payments for 30
00:02:10.720 years let's see where that's going to
00:02:12.840 get them so they started their payments
00:02:15.040 this month December 1st 2023 so the
00:02:18.400 mortgage is a 30-year mortgage at
00:02:22.680 7.75% guys if you're in these ridiculous
00:02:26.040 interest rates I don't care if it was
00:02:28.480 going on in the 80s or not it's going on
00:02:31.200 right now if you didn't have the
00:02:33.120 knowledge in the 1980s and you went
00:02:35.480 ahead and you paid this ridiculous
00:02:37.280 interest then I'm sorry it was only
00:02:39.599 because you weren't taught the truth
00:02:41.400 this video is going to teach you the
00:02:43.000 truth about what that 7.75 interest rate
00:02:45.879 means to you I want everybody that has a
00:02:49.319 mortgage to go get your contract
00:02:51.360 documents right
00:02:52.840 now I
00:02:55.159 wait go to the closing document
00:02:58.760 section look in your closing document
00:03:01.840 section of the
00:03:03.599 contract you're going to see where it
00:03:05.920 says your interest rate I don't care if
00:03:07.959 it's 2% or
00:03:10.000 8% then look in the small print below
00:03:13.120 your interest rate it's going to say in
00:03:16.120 capital letters this is not your
00:03:18.280 interest
00:03:19.599 rate now go down to the next line you're
00:03:22.720 going to see another line that says this
00:03:24.879 is your actual interest rate and if
00:03:27.440 you're at 3% it's going to be
00:03:29.959 approximately 60% this
00:03:33.080 7.75% that's not
00:03:35.560 7.75% take that times 2 and then add a
00:03:38.840 zero they're going to be paying over
00:03:41.840 150% in interest on this mortgage look
00:03:45.560 at your mortgage papers and see if I'm
00:03:47.720 telling the truth this couple is going
00:03:49.840 to have a monthly payment of
00:03:52.079 $967 2016 in month one they're going to
00:03:55.319 pay
00:03:56.400 $871 187 in interest alone Lo how much
00:04:00.959 actually goes towards the house they
00:04:02.680 just bought
00:04:05.079 $99524 are you seeing where I'm going
00:04:08.519 with this month
00:04:10.560 two balance
00:04:14.159 13495 monthly payment
00:04:17.680 9676 interest
00:04:20.600 $871
00:04:22.680 26 principal payment what actually went
00:04:25.800 to the house that they're paying for $95
00:04:29.919 90 how long do you think it's going to
00:04:32.479 take them to pay this home off paying
00:04:34.639 these small little payments towards
00:04:36.280 their actual principal amount 30 years
00:04:39.840 right so I have Carl's mortgage
00:04:42.000 calculator up and you're going to see it
00:04:44.039 here this is going to show you that the
00:04:47.000 actual interest that they're going to
00:04:48.680 pay throughout this 30 years on this
00:04:51.080 mortgage is going to be
00:04:54.360 $23,170
00:04:56.560 35 interest only let's teach you a way
00:05:00.800 that you can beat that and be excited to
00:05:03.840 pay for your home not paying for the
00:05:06.479 bank's home first when you're paying
00:05:09.240 this much interest in every single
00:05:11.280 payment that you're making you might as
00:05:13.199 well drive down the street roll your
00:05:15.240 window down and throw
00:05:17.960 $871 out the window going down the
00:05:20.759 street you know what at least it will
00:05:22.800 help some people on the street that need
00:05:25.080 the money this is going to the banks
00:05:27.639 this is just you making them richer
00:05:30.520 how can you stop that what if you took a
00:05:32.880 $10,000 chunk and put upon this mortgage
00:05:36.039 and I know some of you naysayers out
00:05:37.919 there are saying well who's got
00:05:39.759 $10,000 well guess what there are things
00:05:42.240 called lines of credit at the bank and
00:05:44.720 you can use the lines of credit any way
00:05:46.919 you want to most banks have them
00:05:49.240 available most Credit Unions have them
00:05:51.600 available check it out see if you can't
00:05:53.840 find you a line of credit to do what you
00:05:55.759 are getting ready to see here this is
00:05:58.000 not magic this is is just math so we
00:06:00.880 talked about getting a $110,000 chunk
00:06:03.280 and paying it onto this mortgage
00:06:05.039 principal we also discussed that they
00:06:07.120 have $100 in cash flow every month so
00:06:10.120 when they get the $110,000 line of
00:06:12.120 credit you can use that to put all of
00:06:14.400 your income in and pull all of your
00:06:16.280 expenses out so this is how that will
00:06:18.479 look you have a balance of $10,000 on
00:06:21.199 the line of credit that you got from the
00:06:22.919 bank or credit union your income goes in
00:06:26.120 when the income goes into this line of
00:06:28.319 credit it satisfies any payment that was
00:06:30.639 due that month you can also pay your
00:06:33.199 expenses straight out of this account so
00:06:35.479 when the income goes in in month one the
00:06:37.720 expenses come out the balance comes down
00:06:40.039 to
00:06:40.880 $8,900 now remember the expenses are the
00:06:43.919 home and all of the Liv expenses the
00:06:46.280 food the Gas Utilities whatever it is
00:06:49.039 that they have to pay every single month
00:06:51.080 can come out of this line of credit now
00:06:53.479 we have to figure in some interest here
00:06:55.639 so I figured this line of credit at a
00:06:58.520 high of4
00:07:00.039 14% remember what this was
00:07:03.840 7.75% this is 14% how in the world is
00:07:08.000 this a better deal than just making
00:07:09.800 those mortgage payments so I figured the
00:07:12.199 14% interest on the $10,000 is that the
00:07:15.800 way the bank charges no absolutely not
00:07:18.720 they charge interest based on the
00:07:20.720 average daily balance so when this
00:07:23.000 balance came down to 4,800 after putting
00:07:25.440 in the income that was a low this is the
00:07:28.759 high it would be averaged at the bank
00:07:31.319 before they figured in the interest rate
00:07:33.479 of
00:07:34.440 14% I went ahead and figured the
00:07:36.800 interest rate off of the high $10,000
00:07:39.720 just to leave room for air and just to
00:07:42.039 show that it doesn't matter what your
00:07:44.000 interest rate is on a line of credit you
00:07:46.520 can still beat whatever loan that you're
00:07:48.720 paying over here so the interest at 14%
00:07:51.840 on the $10,000 comes to approximately
00:07:55.360 $117 that brings their balance back up
00:07:57.800 to 9,17
00:08:00.919 month two the income goes in the
00:08:02.919 expenses come out again and so does the
00:08:05.120 interest and the interest at 14% was
00:08:07.639 charged off of the balance of
00:08:09.960 $917 month three the income goes in the
00:08:12.840 expenses come out so does the interest
00:08:15.319 now we're back up to
00:08:17.000 7,17 month four the income goes in the
00:08:20.400 expenses and the interest come back out
00:08:22.759 month 5 same thing look at here it's
00:08:26.159 month six it's paid off it's gone it's
00:08:28.919 over you have paid off the $110,000 that
00:08:31.599 you put on this home so in 6 months
00:08:35.320 doing nothing at all just putting your
00:08:37.240 income in pulling your expenses out
00:08:39.279 leaving this cash flow sitting in there
00:08:41.240 you're going to pay off the $10,000
00:08:43.599 within 6
00:08:44.959 months so what happens if we decide to
00:08:47.839 put $10,000 on this principal amount
00:08:51.399 every s months so if we have the
00:08:54.959 $135,000 balance and they put $10,000
00:08:58.480 from the line of credit on here that of
00:09:00.839 course is going to bring their balance
00:09:02.279 to
00:09:04.360 $125,000 if you know anything about an
00:09:06.680 amortization schedule and I'm showing
00:09:08.959 you one now that is what every loan is
00:09:11.519 set up on an amortization schedule so
00:09:14.680 every month you have a set monthly
00:09:17.120 payment right this schedule will show
00:09:19.560 you how much of your payment is going
00:09:22.000 towards interest and how much is going
00:09:24.240 towards principal which is what I showed
00:09:26.320 you right here so according to the Amer
00:09:29.680 schedule a $10,000 Chunk on this
00:09:33.760 $135,000 mortgage brings it down to
00:09:37.800 $125,000 but it skips from December 2023
00:09:42.880 all the way to July of
00:09:46.320 2030 yeah you heard me right
00:09:50.279 2030 that means that because they were
00:09:52.920 allowed to skip almost seven years on
00:09:55.560 the amortization schedule they are going
00:09:58.160 to save6 $6
00:10:00.959 5,520 in interest for a one-time $10,000
00:10:06.040 chunk that they are going to pay off in
00:10:08.640 six months so let's see what a $10,000
00:10:12.680 chunk every s months is going to do to
00:10:15.440 this mortgage and to the interest that
00:10:17.920 they're going to pay throughout the time
00:10:20.079 they spend paying off the mortgage if we
00:10:22.480 go ahead and do a second chunk it skips
00:10:25.040 the schedule to April of
00:10:27.360 2035 over 5 more years saving
00:10:31.560 37,6 181 more dollars in interest two
00:10:35.639 chunks 7 months apart $10,000 each
00:10:39.800 they've saved over
00:10:41.760 $100,000 in interest alone so what does
00:10:45.160 that mean if they make nine more $10,000
00:10:49.200 chunks onto this mortgage this mortgage
00:10:53.120 is going to be paid in full in 77 months
00:10:57.360 or 6 and A2 years so remember what I
00:11:00.320 said at the beginning of the video the
00:11:02.600 total mortgage interest that they were
00:11:04.519 going to pay in this 30-year mortgage
00:11:08.240 was
00:11:10.880 $23,170
00:11:12.720 35 remember the total interest that
00:11:15.720 they're going to pay doing these chunks
00:11:19.079 in every seven months is going to be
00:11:24.240 $3,644 of mortgage interest because
00:11:27.079 remember in between each 10 $1,000 chunk
00:11:30.279 they're still making the mortgage
00:11:32.040 payment how much interest are they going
00:11:34.040 to pay using this $10,000 line of credit
00:11:37.160 every 6 months how much are they going
00:11:39.680 to pay well they're not going to pay any
00:11:42.160 more than $
00:11:44.680 5,159 in interest on this line of credit
00:11:47.920 throughout the 77 months that they have
00:11:50.160 this mortgage so that means that they
00:11:52.000 are going to pay a total on the mortgage
00:11:54.519 and the line of credit of
00:11:56.880 $36,800
00:11:58.959 how much were they going to pay on the
00:12:00.320 30-year mortgage
00:12:03.639 $23,170
00:12:05.959 35 so what does that mean that they
00:12:08.360 saved
00:12:11.360 $176,300
00:12:14.120 35 they have saved in interest
00:12:18.480 alone people that's an interest alone
00:12:21.880 not only that they have saved 23 and A2
00:12:26.120 years 23 and A2 years on their
00:12:31.760 mortgage they're done 77 months it's
00:12:36.440 over is that insane I mean I even do
00:12:40.279 these scenarios and I think to myself oh
00:12:42.720 wow I must have done something wrong
00:12:44.120 because those figures just aren't right
00:12:46.120 no no it's right this is the difference
00:12:50.519 of allowing a mortgage to absorb your
00:12:54.600 hard earned money and moving into a line
00:12:58.959 of credit that you can control because
00:13:02.199 you're putting your income in pulling
00:13:04.480 your expenses out letting your cash flow
00:13:07.079 work this down every month saving tens
00:13:09.760 of thousands of dollars in interest this
00:13:12.120 is simple math you have to run the
00:13:14.920 numbers yourself I don't care if you're
00:13:17.440 two years into your mortgage you can
00:13:19.440 still save a killing and get out of that
00:13:21.519 mortgage fast by using a line of credit
00:13:24.839 there are personal lines of credit there
00:13:26.680 are home equity lines of credit there
00:13:28.880 are lines of credit that can take over
00:13:30.760 your whole mortgage called a first lean
00:13:32.880 HELOC you have options you just didn't
00:13:36.120 realize you did and for goodness sake
00:13:38.760 know what you're getting into before you
00:13:40.800 refinance that house it is exactly what
00:13:43.480 you saw here they are just resetting all
00:13:46.199 of that interest for you to pay it
00:13:48.800 again please think before you
00:13:52.240 refinance please ask me questions I'll
00:13:54.839 be glad to help you but for goodness
00:13:56.759 sake save your wealth put this
00:14:00.360 $871 into an account for yourself put
00:14:03.880 this
00:14:04.680 $65,000 back into your infinite banking
00:14:07.519 policy back into your own Bank to where
00:14:10.079 you can serve yourself and you'll never
00:14:12.000 have to go to another bank to get a loan
00:14:14.079 like this I want you to hear what I'm
00:14:16.680 saying this is something you can control
00:14:20.199 and the bank gives you the tools to
00:14:22.079 control it it's just that you have been
00:14:24.600 programmed to receive
00:14:27.000 loans there are lines of credit that are
00:14:30.079 simple interest loans are advertise
00:14:33.040 schedules with the interest front loaded
00:14:36.160 meaning you're going to pay most of the
00:14:38.120 interest within seven years why are you
00:14:40.920 going to pay it within seven years
00:14:43.399 because they know statistically every
00:14:46.040 American Family moves out of their home
00:14:48.399 within seven years or they refinance
00:14:51.399 within the first four years you are
00:14:54.120 programmed to do exactly what you're
00:14:56.320 doing buying your home with a mortgage
00:14:59.399 we all grew up in this now we have the
00:15:02.720 information we need to change our minds
00:15:04.920 and to get back into control of our
00:15:07.680 finances that is all I want for you guys
00:15:10.839 I want everybody out there to understand
00:15:13.600 you can control what's happening to your
00:15:15.959 finances you just weren't aware before
